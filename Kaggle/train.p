aV@SDL OK, but I would hope they'd sign him to a one-year contract to start with. Give him the chance to be reliable and productive, but give themselves the out if all his time off has hurt his playing skills or if he falls back into old habits.
p3227
aVYeah and where are you now?

Please, show us some examples because it's starting to look like your threats and fears and warnings are nothing but HOT AIR.

aVCraig, we have been saying from the start that this is a very entertaining show.\u005cxa0 It awakens the horny little Goth in me.\u005cxa0 I met my boyfriend during the first season and one of the first thing we did was watch AHS at my house.\u005cxa0 I know he likes me and all but to this day he is sure I am far creepier and kinkier than he could ever be.\u005cxa0 Thanks, American Horror Story.\u005cxa0 Sweet Clam loves you.

p3252
aVA good article, which, for all the good it will do, could have been delivered to a brick wall.
p3253
aVHead's up warning...another source of funding for Media Matters is Peter Lewis of the Progessive Insurance Company.

p3264
aVGood job, fellas. I didn't quite read the rules about a signature piece, but I guess that was as good as any. I found some great blogs to follow, and to share over at G+. If I'm not commenting on your blogs, it's because I always throw my two cents in when I post my share. Add me on there if you are a Googler. \u005cnhttps://plus.google.com/109258118458627782001/posts. Again, congratulations to the winners, and I hope we get the chance to submit something else. This was fucking fun.
p3265
aVI say hang is ass in the center of the town to let it be known that this type of behavior gets this type of punishment... The lady had a kid 1 week ago. Women aren't safe to have sex after child birth for AT LEAST 6 weeks. So even if this WAS\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0consensual, it would have been wayyyyy too soon and hurt the lady. I am so glad the the baby is so young and will not remember this event happening in it's house and I hope the mother recovers quickly.

aVOKC should work out a deal to get a PG who plays more like Parker or CP3.  I think Nash at the point, and move Westbrook to SG that team would be unstoppable.

The problem being those who are loud on the issue are ill educated and you can be sure they wouldn't be rushing to fight anyone, they would be cowering in the background. My wife is Argentinean and she is the first one to recognize the stupidity of the claims. Some of muppet think they fought their Independence against the UK, morons the lot of them. The answer is simple, if we were the leading colonial force, you would be an ENGLISH speaking country, you aren't, because werent it was Spain, Portugal, France, our interests were commercial. Also the worst part is they themselves exterminated the natives, the Spanish started it but actually it was the newly formed Argies which did most of the killing of the native, lovely eh? Clueless stuff, you wonder why the Government gets away with corruption, so many ignorant people thats why...you shouldnt judge ALL by the standard, these a huge amount of Argies who see the Cristina drum beating for what it is, the same as ALL presidents of Argentina do, using it to cover their failing.

I think it\u005c\u005c's reasonable that when you invite someone to make a professional presentation at YOUR company that YOU provide necessary protections for that individual. I don\u005c\u005c't care whether Cleveland was employed or just "a hanger-on" a professional guest should not have been left unattended in the hands of someone dangerous that was there admittedly with Baby and Slim\u005c\u005c's knowledge and permission.

The Tea Party when it rallies or protests does it legally with brains. We pay the permits, arrange the events, say our piece, and then clean up and go home. The occupukes on the other hand. Are not only different, they are opposite. They trespass, they steal, they show up without permission. They damage private property, they collect urine and feces to throw on people. They set fires, they smash store windows. They rape young girls. I can go on and on. Oh and the heat, AC and warm beds were all paid for by those people. don't kid yourself that we are not committed to our cause because we are not stupid like you or OWS.

aV@nilbymouth \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnYou are right concerning Campbell.  My bad.  The QB carosel has me mixed up.  Anyways, I still don't like Knapp and think we went that road with him once before and do not need to revisit it again.  Cable obviously did not think too high of him if he stripped his playcalling duties and decided to call the plays himself.  If Knapp was truely great at what he does, he would have had some positive influence on this team with his quarterbacks, and in my opinion, he didn't....Carson Palmer needs a guy like Saunders whose offensive connection to him is undeniable...

aVThis is so American. Load of utter 'positive people makes positive lives' fake christian bullshit.\u005cxa0\u005cn\u005cnPut it this way, take 2 for example:Give up complaining. This to me just reads like 'become a walk over'. If we all gave up complaining, nothing great would get done or crap would be accepted. Go into a hairdressers, get a shit haircut for $100. Don't complain because you are a happy, pissed-off with your shit haircut, person who's just been taken for a ride.\u005cxa0Give up the luxury of criticism. For a start it's not a luxury. You can be critical if you want. I believe it is a trait that I enjoy. Why? Many people are idiots. It's the truth. If you are in a job and you don't criticise people who do crap work then you'll have an office/workplace full of people who can't do their job.These are basic personality traits of intelligent people. But I guess retards are happier than all of us.

aVSorry, I hate to be one of *those* people (if they exist here. haha) but, I posted this juts a few minutes ago in the old thread and I wanted to move it over here because it\u005c\u005c's a bit mind-blowing.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnFrom her letter to Tiger Woods:\u005c\u005cn"The world seems to be all up in your business, and I\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99m sorry about that. I really am. What happens in your life, in your car and in your marriage should not be a public issue. Unfortunately, because you are a public figure, sometimes your private life does become public. I guess it comes with the territory and maybe you\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99re used to it by now. It still must bite, though......Of course I long for you to own your mistakes, Tiger. If you aren\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t already, and I hope you are, man up to the pain you caused your wife and family. Let the hot searing anger she has for what you did change you, not harden you. It must be a hard road to walk, both for her dealing with what you have done, and for you, making sense of where to go from here when you are in the public eye the way you are. Stand behind your actions by way of fully admitting and acknowledging them to yourself. Don\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t lie to yourself or pretend they aren\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t as bad as others think or that somehow you were justified. You weren\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t. You are reaping what you sowed, Tiger. Own it. But see, whether you acknowledge all that publicly to your fans is entirely up to you. It makes no difference to me if your public apologies are detailed or not. For it is not us you need to be apologizing to. Because you are well known does not make you accountable to the public. Share only what you want, and keep the rest private. Keep it all private, if you can. But, and I speak from painful experience here, coming entirely clean does feel good. Really good....\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnTonight, I am praying for restoration for your marriage. Having almost lost mine, because of my own sin and pride as well as that of my husband, I now hold redemption in marriage in such high regard....But my advice, as someone who has been there? Don\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t hide it. Own it. Embrace it. Learn from it. Change your ways. Feel repentance. Apologize to your wife. Seek counseling, lots of it if you can. Let the searing pain and guilt and remorse you hopefully feel inspire in you to see yourself for what you are: A wretched sinner in need of forgiveness.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnYou, your heart, and that of your wife and children are what matter. Focus on them, on saving your marriage, if that is what you want to do. And truly, my husband and I pray that it is what you want to do."\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn

aVThe comments about this sad story only proves how "smart" some people are in this once great nation. Kenya is an US ally and have been for years, including during W. Bush's administration. If this "crash" was an act of terror, this would not be the first time Kenyans faced acts of terror due to their alliance with the US. Remember the US embassy terror bombings in the late 1990's? By the way Kenya is 80% Christian and the people are not starving to death, for those who somehow believe Kenyans are all terrorist trying to destroy America because Obama's father was Kenyan. Get an education before posting "smart" comments about a nation you "smart" posters obviously know nothing about. My heart goes out to the good people of Kenya during this tragic event.

aVPosted at 08:45 AM ET, 06/07/2012\u005cnObama is killing the Democratic Party\u005cnBy Jennifer Rubin\u005cn\u005cnPresident Obama, I have frequently argued, has been fabulous for the conservative movement. He spurred the creation of the tea party. He helped the GOP win the House majority in 2010 and make big gains in the Senate. His Obamacare has helped revive the Commerce Clause and given a boost to conservative jurisprudence. His refusal to support human rights has caused a bipartisan revulsion and reminded us that foreign policy must be girded by American values. He\u005cu2019s sent independents running into the GOP\u005cu2019s arms. He\u005cu2019s forced conservatives to think hard and express eloquently principles of religious liberty, limited government, free markets and Constitutional democracy.\u005cn\u005cnObama also has wreaked havoc in the the Democratic Party. He\u005cu2019s firmly affixed the \u005cu201ctax and spend\u005cu201d label to it after Bill Clinton declared that the era of big government was over. He\u005cu2019s made Clinton into a pitch man for Mitt Romney. His rejection of the Keystone XL pipeline has split the party. His refusal to adopt the Simpson-Bowles commission\u005cu2019s recommendations has turned Democrats into reactionaries, defending the status quo on entitlements. He\u005cu2019s alienated Jewish voters. He\u005cu2019s re-McGovernized the party, which now stands for appeasing despotic powers, turning on allies and slashing defense spending.\u005cn\u005cn(Pack it up dude, your eviction notice will be delivered in November)

They created tricks and illegal laws and rules to get ahead in America for hundreds of years; they raped and killed destorying families and now because a person makes a choice to go to all black school where a teacher ca see a black student for themselves, or gets a interview when a white doesn't its reverse racism.

aVThe "wedge Issue" isn\u005c\u005c't whether women use birth control. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0The issue is Obama\u005c\u005c's continued and frequent and deliberate abuse of the Constitution. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0It is one more example of his utter willingness to destroy the principles in our founding document so that he can dictate to the populace as he sees fit. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0He has shown all too often that he cares not for the First Amendment, especially if anyone uses it to speak against his policies - they are attacked, branded racist, labeled as unintelligent. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0He does not respect the Second Amendment (one of the best protections against both criminals and overweening government power). \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0He cares not for the 10th Amendment, because he excoriates the states for exercising powers delegated to them by the Constitution - that of Arizona to protect its own borders and its budget; that of Texas to draw its electoral districts; the right of states to control their own budgets on a wide range of issues. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0He does not respect the 14th Amendment if it means enforcing statutes against blacks who violate them, such as the infamous Chicago voting rights case; or the directive by his Dept. of Education to colleges and universities to reduce the legal standards of proof for finding of rape and sexual assault when brought against a male, so that a man\u005c\u005c's career can be ruined on sayso even when a police investigation shows the accuser to be lying; or his Dept. of Just-Us "Guidance Memorandum" that allows colleges and universities to (wink, wink) substitute the term "critical mass" for "quotas" and throw clear law into the trashcan while pursuing racial preferences. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0He does not believe in the right to contract guaranteed by Article I of the Constitution - note his "giving" labor unions position ahead of stockholders and bondholders in the grants to Chrysler and GM. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0Note his efforts to curtail what companies pay their executives - a matter for stockholders who own those companies, not the government.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAnother issue is his apparent belief that the public is incredibly stupid. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0His "compromise" on the birth control requirement for Catholic institutions simply means that the overall rates for health insurance will be raised for those institutions to pay for both the administrative costs of "outreach" as well as for the birth control devices - including abortifacients such as the "morning after" pill. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0Nothing is free, but one would never know it by looking at his "budgets."

aVHow A CSM Works. \u005cn   After a hand is over the cards just used are placed back into the shuffler to be mixed with the other cards in the shoe. Shuffle Master\u005cu2019s King uses an elevator system to randomize the cards. As the elevator is moved up and down, cards are randomly inserted into one of the 19 shelves in the elevator. The shuffler randomly selects a shelf of cards to deliver into the shoe. Because of the non-linear process, every discard re-inserted following a hand has a chance of appearing in the next round.   Although Shuffle Master says The King differs from their competitors continuous shufflers because the others use a linear design most CSMs so the same thing. They put the discards back into play and does away with the dealers having to stop to physically shuffle the cards at the end of a shoe. \u005cnThe House Edge    The continuous shufflers have no benefits for the player and has been dubbed the "uncomfortable shoes". It eliminates card counting for the skilled player and will also have a major disadvantage for the basic strategy player. It speeds up the game! \u005cnWhen the CSM was first introduced many players felt it would probably increase the house edge. As it turns out this is not entirely true. Michael Shackleford, The Wizard of Odds did a mathematical analysis of the Continuous Shuffling Machines and found that there was a very slight reduction in the house edge. \u005cnIn a four deck game the edge is 0.034 percent and in an eight deck game is tis0.014 percent. Before you get excited about a slight reduction in the house edge you have to realize that when the casino uses a CSM the speed of the games is increased by about 20 percent. The basic strategy player stands to lose more in the long run because they are exposing more money to the house edge. \u005cnAs a player I feel it\u005cu2019s a treat to visit a casino that offers double and single deck games. I would hate to see these games eliminated altogether. Even a multi deck shoe game is preferable to the Continuous Shuffling Machines. The best way you can let the casinos know this is by refusing to play Blackjack at the casinos that use a CSM for their Blackjack games

aV*replying here to save space*\u005cnI think I understand what you're feeling. Put it this way, as someone who is actively involved in the systematic elimination of other human beings, I totally understand how all this movie shit really aint that important in the grand scheme of things. However, I and others in a similar situation use them to decompress from that real shit, and more often than not movies help express stuff in ways only film can. It does have value.\u005cnAnd to your hypothetical situation about the victim using faith to survive, I would recount the <i>very real</i> examples of young afghan girls getting their faces mutilated by their own family over irrational outdated customs/religious beliefs. Is it better to have faith that produces these atrocites. I don't know, I dont have an answer. Alls I know is although I thoroughly disagree with the absolute abolition of religion, its very obvious that we have to find a way to evolve our thought processes. \u005cnOh, and as far as movie related articles are concerned, Scientology is famously a very big force in the entertainment industry, as many of the big name A-list actors follow that faith. I think it warrants discussion. And don't forget, theres a movie coming out later this year about the Hubbard, the trailer for which was covered recently here. Worth checking out.

aVGosh, Peggy Hill ... Don't make me laugh.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 In addition to money ... Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 Both will do the same thing in office just with entirely different styles.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 Newt ruffles feathers all day long drawing stark contrasts even when it means lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV ... unbelievable.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 And since Peggy Hill knows far less about national politics than I do since I have studied it for 25 years, I'm not inclined to be persuaded by her.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 She describes the political scene like I used to 15 years ago ... with little to no expertise, so I don't pay her a lot of attention when we disagree.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnPeggy Hill is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake!\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 Newt is the world's best field general but his\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0temper and tone are wearing me out and I'm conservative ... I can only imagine how offended Independents are beginning to feel.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... that is essential in beating Dingle Barry ... Peggy Hill sounds like an OWS'er ranting that Mitt had more money ... thank God he did ... that's what it's all about!  So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIf Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he's got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that's all Barry does.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI don't care too much that Mitt is uninspiring ... I know he can beat Owebamao and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBy the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBut for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable .... that's what you're supposed to do!\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBTW  -  Remember the Sirens???\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBeautiful half-woman, half-bird-like Newt creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot everything including their own safety. The Sirens are Newtish sisters who lure sailors to their death. The sonsg of the Sirens are irresistible but they reside beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroy the sailors' boat when they try to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast ... just sayin'.

aV@aarongmyers to be honest the translation of Ender's Game isn't great... much like the first book in the HP series, which is why I have been avoiding the challenge in Chinese for so long. But I agree about finding something fun to read. The key is being able to provide yourself with the ability to have comprehensible input while you are reading. Going to the dictionary for every other word and still not understanding what you are reading is one of the most painful things to deal with as a language learner.

aVyeah well director interpretation isn't always the best insight for things like this, especially with something with such a rabid fan base. On top of that i think they are condensing more than i would have liked...even if the golden age was kinda meh in comparison to the drama going on now, i would have at least liked for them to show them doing their thing on the battle field.

aVFrom what I can see, most men like women who are physically fit.  You don't have to look like a runway model, but YOU DO need to look like you take care of yourself, eat reasonably well, and exercise.  Studies have shown (though I'm referencing information I read YEARS ago) that WM actually prefer a larger body type than WW, but not as large as BM or HM.  WW seem to want to be a size zero, while WM seem to like the athletic Swedish model body.  Anyway, I think both of the ladies above look very attractive.  However, I don't understand this fixation on having butts and thighs that are WAY out of proportion with the rest of one's figure.  That isn't attractive to me, personally.  I just don't get it.  And, seeing a HUGE rear on a small girl just doesn't make any sense.  I don't know how it's physically possible to have skinny arms, legs, waist, and still have a humongous derriere and/or thighs.  Many men like a nice-sized butt, including WM and AM (I know from experience), so a BW's full, round bottom isn't necessarily a problem for men in general.  But, MOST men (including BM) don't want a bottom that's so obese it looks like it's own planet.  Get and stay in shape for your own health and opportunities, BW.

Why not leave both powers to the owner, "Allah" and allow him to fight for himself? Or is he not capable? We are not afraid of you; we are not afraid of death. Everyone will eventually die, both the killer and the killed; our Lord Jesus long time ago warned us about sects like yours and encouraged us not to be afraid for you can only kill the body but can do no further harm after that: you can't kill our souls which ultimately goes back to our God; so kill all you can, Jesus will forever remain Lord!

aV@SRQDawgs15 @TheLadySportswriter Some of the opponents scoring were Touchdowns that Murray threw to their Defensive backs or we gave the opponents really short fields.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI am not saying UGA doesn't have great talent on both sides of the ball.  However, the consistency on offense is missing.  The short dump-off passes are missing. And, obviously our running game and O-Line play were missing.  However, the boneheaded CT runs up the middle, the flat footed draw plays, and the fumbles at critical times by Murray and the pick 6's had to demoralize our young defense.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnPersonally, I would like to see us never get behind in a game and to win every game by 3 touchdowns.

aVHow is it reasonable, Anon, when Harper has done none of the things you attribute to Fascism? All-powerful leader? Has to stand for re-election in three years. Strict social order? You're joking, right? Glorification of militarism? The troops have been recalled and their budget trimmed. Opposition parties? Hale and hearty and full of piss and vinegar. Elimination of organized labour? No, they did that to themselves by pricing themselves out of the market. Advancement of business over individuals? Elaborate. Ethno-centrism? Try Qu\u005cxe9bec, Thomas Mulcair's home ground. Disparagement of the Constitution? That's the SCC's specialty. Belittling the courts? Who doesn't, these days, and for good reason. Dissolution of MP power? Do you see the House of Commons burning (along with those crosses in Prince George)? Spying on ordinary citizens? Child pornographers are not ordinary citizens.\u005cn\u005cnJudging by the raving of Harper's enemies on these blogs, if he wins another majority, there's going to be a worldwide tinfoil shortage.

aVSo you don't actually care about making women feel welcome as part of your professional community, which is generally impossible for a woman living in a sexist society to do (this one) when attention is being drawn to how her colleagues see her as a sexual object. Why don't you just admit it and be honest? I would feel really refreshed if someone like you said, for once, "We don't want women in our field." It would look stupid and ridiculous -- since why would you throw away half the available talent just because you want to sexualize everything? -- but then we could actually discuss the real point instead of derailing, dismissive, prevaricating, and dissembling discourse of which this one is an excellent example.

He is a profligate and a drunkard." 21 Then all the men of his town shall stone him to death."\u005cn\u005cnMatthew 5:18 :\u005cn"I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished."\u005cn\u005cnYou believers are dangerous.

I have no clue what Trayvon did in his last seconds of life.  We know he was shot from between 1 and 18 inches, in the chest, which is consistent with Zimmerman's story.  Trayvon had at least a few seconds of life after he was shot, and who knows what his reaction was...  judging from how his body was found, he crawled off Zimmerman and died.  You don't have to roll someone over to check their pulse at the neck.\u005cn\u005cnI'm not quite able to figure out just what you're suggesting, but his position at death is irrelevant.

How the hell do you function in life? Oh wait, you dont. You sit your fat worthless ass at a computer all day ranting about gay marriage. I hate to break it to you but I guarantee your darling son Sam is going to grow up to be the butt pirate you so hate. What are you going to do then? Throw a bible at his head? It wont knock the gay out of him! Even worse little Sara is going to grow up to be a......LIBERAL! Gasp! Oh nos! So your tweenie is going to be a fatty, sammy a gay, and sara a tree hugging hippie!

aVConservatives are to blame for some of this for wimping out on it. Why are we not working on laws to ban gay marriage on a federal level and let\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s not stop there? No gay adoptions we need a man and a woman in these kids lives. Regardless of what liberal propaganda tells us, conservatives out number liberals 3 to 1 why do you think fox is so big and liberal radio shows are basically non existent. Why is it 85% of Americans were against Obama care and yet because of the majority in congress it was passed anyway? Conservatives need to get off their keesters. In Arizona these things are not radical, there mellow. Start working on making homosexuality illegal start far to the right just as the liberals start far to the left and they get it (Obama care etc.) no this is the conservative\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s fault. Gay people need to feel shame in what their doing, not heroic as the liberal media makes them sound. Make it illegal and that will help in giving them the shame they should already feel. It\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s just not right it\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s not a matter of hate I guess I hate rapists to because I don\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t feel that\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s right either.\u005c\u005cnIf we glorified rapists and made them sound all heroic would it become a RIGHT to be who they are? That's how they were born. They didn't choose to be that way they just are so they should have the RIGHT to rape any man woman child or animal. This is the liberal logic. Next their going to want to pass laws that being a rapist is just sexual orientation. You would even see ignorant people trying to say the bible says its ok. If it were ok then 2 men could have a baby without help from any women and 2 women could have a child without using any sperm from a man. Nope sorry just not possible.

aVIdiocy. Just say things then give no facts. Here's some facts. 3,000,000 people missing from the work force. The lowest workforce in 30 yrs at 63.2%. Median household income down 7%. Gas prices have doubled. Debt rising at a 4.2 billion dollar a day clip, and rising. 48% of Americans are below the poverty level. 46% more Americans on food stamps. Electric bills up 300 dollars a year. Average age of an American owned car 10 yrs. I can go on, and on. This POTUS is a joke. Look at his past voting records in Illinois and in the US Senate. Consistantly voting present or abstaining. He's a consumate politician. Strictly worried about covering his ass, and saving his job. Thank the stars he is alienating the Catholics. After that fiasco you can stick a fork in him, he's done. HGis IQ is on a par with the mouth breathers that voted for him. All he's got is those mean ole corporations, and class warfare. Only the uneducated will fall for that. There's a lot of them though.

This reminds me of the guy who was at a bar and a big muscular biker walks in and takes his drink away and drinks it! The little guy says "I went to work late and got fired...I went home and my wife was in bed with a stranger and then my dog bit me. I took my last 5 bucks here and bought a drink and dissolved some poison in it to kill myself and you come along and drink my drink! So....how was your day?"

aVSantorum needs to stop whining about the negative adds - he\u005c\u005c's been free-riding at Newt\u005c\u005c's expense this entire time so now it\u005c\u005c's his turn in the box.  After all, he\u005c\u005c's a lawyer and needs to suck it up - but of course he doesn\u005c\u005c't want people to know he\u005c\u005c's an attorney since that might spoil his choir boy image.  Newt said he wasn\u005c\u005c't for mandates so rick needs to stop promoting it.  Besides, rick didn\u005c\u005c't mind piling on with Mitt to try to bury Newt early on.  But at the end of the day, what solutions does rick bring to the table? He didn\u005c\u005c't do anything when he was in congress and time after time he ABANDONED HIS PRINCIPLES TO PLEASE THE LIBERALS IN PENNSYLVANIA! And what did it buy him?  A 19 point drubbing in his re-election!\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAs for the campaign, he\u005c\u005c's brought no rational or reasonable solutions to the table - instead, like mitt, his best solution has been to say "I agree with Newt"  - and his economic logic is elementary and fatally flawed.  Newt has been spot on predicting where king hussein obama is leading us, including the attack on the church, which is simply the avenue to establish the legal precedent that the WH has the power to tell us - all of us - how to act, how to respond, and what to think!  That\u005c\u005c's the real issue from obama and his henchwoman michellivelli!  Not only will rick be behind on tidal wave of rot that will flood him if elected, he will not be able to get congress to do a darn thing!  And when his failed 4 years are over, the demonic dems will come back to power with a vengence by simply pointing at rick\u005c\u005c's miserable record and lack of ability to lead in a hail storm of enemies on both sides of him!  \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSo rick should just suck it up, stop whining and run the gauntlet like Newt has had to ... if he can\u005c\u005c't stand the heat then he can\u005c\u005c't lead the country!

I will predict that his rein at the top is over, He inadvertently thought that his viewers were so sucked in that they would buy anything he says as gospel. He underestimated his audience badly. It pissed him off that the meek would dare to question his almighty wisdom. There are many people going to be raised up these days to try and prevent the takeover of this county from the rich establishment trying to tell the people what they should do. What we have found out is that most of Fix have the same agenda as the dems,.To be in control! Thats whats going on here. To control the money the masses and the airwaves. Keep you distracted so you wont notice whats really going on. Another Sun Tzu law. Never underestimate your opponent, Big mistake . Tonight they are trying to remind the people their job is to root out the facts. Sorry Bill it wont work with people who see a fix when its in. Trying to say a poll that was flooded by romney people would make it even. Look at all the other polls on these sites that you didnt get to promote on your show. Of course the moneyman would see to it you were"fair"Thats how you make your money. Just step outside for a minute while we kill mitts opposition and when it happens you start talking about all the lies and negative campaigning.Horse feathers. Anybody who isn\u005c\u005c't for romney sees it very clearly.Hmmm You will know when the next ratings cycle. Because thats what you are to them people. His rating numbers.They mess up that fair and balanced bit and the gig is up. He knows your hot buttons and he pushes them all the time doing what the elite do.

aVPoor deluded psychopaths. News flash, marriage is UNNATURAL. It is a construct of beings that have stepped out of nature for the most part. Construction, vehicles, technology.. all "unnatural" if you think about it.\u005cn\u005cnNow, if you're talking about the pairing off into couples by animals in nature, sure.. they do that. But it has never been about property rights for them, like it used to be for humans. And there are same sex couples in nature as well, since it's about making life easier in groups than it is by yourself. So, by THAT fact and the logic that goes with it, gay marriage is AS natural as hetero marriage.\u005cn\u005cnYou fuckers never have a reasonable leg to stand on.. it's always your invisible sky fairy and some bullshit some cave dweller spewed 1800 years ago.

aVThank you for your thoughtful and informative post Lisa. You covered the pros and cons of public opinion and didn\u005c\u005c't shy away from stating your own. Kudos. I feel it\u005c\u005c's your duty to say where you stand in full transparency and to balance the press that SGK is getting for the opposite reason. If both opinions are not provided then only ONE opinion will be weighed. Readers deserve both. The difference is that you stood for yourself, not for Elisa or Jory. SGK leaders weren\u005c\u005c't so transparent, they instead used the entire organization to front their personal mission.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnOur online "voice votes" carry far more weight than the political elections. Once women understand that, they\u005c\u005c'll understand their responsibility to say what they think often, loudly, and with civility.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI am very dismayed by SGK\u005c\u005c's stand because it is playing to politics and not helping women. I will not be supporting SGK any longer. There are many places that are more focused in their mission to help all women, Planned Parenthood is one of them. When I was a starving college student, PP was my primary health screener. Later I did volunteer work at PP to pay back for my healthcare; one of the things we were trained on was how to check yourself for lumps and why it was important. They have been consistent in their mission to help all women stay alive and healthy often during the most dire of times.

Because they dont want to have to force their vulnerable members seeking re-election to have to vote on a budget that should offend hard working taxpayers. and if they dont have a budget printed out then its easier to blow that budget out of the water without taking the heat they deserve. its time the people that owned the white house , the senate and the house for the first 2 WHOLE YEARS of this idiots administration to own up to the mess they "created or saved"\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0

aV<strong>Whom the Gods Would Destroy</strong>\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cnIt seems that<strong> Obama, in a classic act of hubris, has created the means of his own destruction.</strong>  Through his great historical contribution, his health care bill, he has struck what was surely<strong> intended to be a lethal blow against the oldest organization on earth -- an organization with something on the order of a billion members, with a cadre of hundreds of thousands of highly trained and dedicated personnel, and a history of overcoming political threats that make Obama look like a kindergartner.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI\u005c\u005c'm referring, of course, to the Catholic Church</strong>.  Now, I don\u005c\u005c't mean that the Archangel Gabriel will appear out of the East to scourge the administration with a blazing sword, though I would pay to see that.  What I\u005c\u005c'm saying is that <strong>Obama has at last taken the step that we all knew he had in him, the ultimate act of arrogance and contempt that will bring the forces of history down upon him.</strong>\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe left has always underestimated the Catholic Church.  "<strong>How many divisions has the pope?" Stalin once asked Molotov, mocking the Church\u005c\u005c's powerlessness in the modern era.  He was not around to see John Paul II rend the Bolshevik kingdom in twain at the climax of the Cold War, utilizing the only forces he required: moral certainty and absolute faith in the divine mission.</strong>  Most American leftists are a little different, viewing the Church as an anachronism, obsessed with medieval ideas having no place in the third millennium and populated with strange figures in outmoded clothing, if not with an endless parade of child-molesters.  \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn<strong>What they overlook is two thousand years of history</strong>.  An organization does not survive for that length of time -- and no other organization has -- without internalizing things not completely understood by even the deepest thinkers among us.  <strong>\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe Church survived the fall of Rome, the barbarians, the first Muslim upsurge, several schisms, the Renaissance princes, the 20th-century totalitarians, and its own plunges into decadence, and it will also survive modernism.</strong>  Which is in fact what it confronts in Obama: a man of vast though superficial sophistication and little insight who has punched all the tickets available to him in his epoch and culture and truly believes there is nothing else. <strong> And now this man, afraid of revealing his own college transcripts, thinks he can take on the Church of Peter, founded a millennium before the appearance of any nation now existing on this earth.</strong>\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnRead more: http://www.americanthinker.com/2012/02/whom_the_gods_would_destroy.html#ixzz1mKnbY0d3

Oh boo fucking hoo, that mean man said "you're not special". I watched this thinking this guy is gonna be some jack ass and in reality, he gave a great speech and spoke some beautiful truth.

I hope you'll consider the lives of those people while you're debating this tough issue.

We need money for our buses or the buses wont run - then the tax is approved "again" and yet the buses wont run. Then next voting block - uh you are not going to have a fire dept, teachers, blah blah blah so lets give them all a raise that 75% cannot afford. so we lose our homes they get a raise - perfectly fair. I really think everyone needs to suck it up - no wonder they are worried about turkey sandwiches. God my parents would have been on prison for the Bologna spread that they ground up every week. But then again - we had to walk home we did not have a "car pool" taking us from step to step. My dad made milk from 1 gal add enough powdered milk to make 3 gals. Add to corn flakes = child abuse.

aVI'm giving up with you now. Lying and Perverting the course of Justice are two completely different things which can't be used interchangably - it doesn't even matter what you say unless you are under arrest at the time as it is the actual arrest that gives them the power to repeat what you have said in court. As in "You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention something you later rely on in court. anything YOU DO SAY may be taken and given in evidence". So unless the passengers were arrested for your non-existant crime and then agreed to give a statement against the driver who was doing them a favour, who would then subsequently have to have admitted all wrongdoing in front of a judge.\u005cn\u005cnIt isn't more likely than I think, it's probably even less likely than I think

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) had determined that the real estate finance firm and others like it were \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cscams\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d and the congresswoman\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s measure would have overturned a federal ban that would have allowed the shady enterprises to keep raking in lucrative profits..For years the firms acted as a middleman to help sellers finance down payments so that low-income buyers could qualify for mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA). The lobbyist who paid Waters\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 husband represented the nation\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s largest such middleman (Sacrament-based Nehemiah Corp.), which stood to lose hundreds of millions of dollars if the ban wasn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t reversed by friendly lawmakers like Waters. .Implemented in 2008, the federal ban was never overturned but not for lack of effort on Waters\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 part. The ten-term congresswoman sponsored legislation three times to stop the ban or repeal it once it became law. She claims she did it because the program allowed hundreds of thousands of low-income families to become homeowners. .News of this latest scandal comes as the House Ethics Committee prepares to try Waters for using her influence to steer $12 million in federal bailout funds to a failing bank (that subsequently got shut down by the government) in which she and her board member husband held shares. .A few months ago the congresswoman got in trouble again for skirting federal elections rules with a crooked fundraising gimmick that allows her to receive unlimited amounts of donations from certain contributors. Instead of raising most of her campaign funds from individuals and political action committees, Waters sells her endorsement to other politicians and political causes for as much as $45,000 a pop, allowing her to rake in hundreds of thousands of dollars in short periods of time. **************Neil Goldschmidt \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx93 Democrat \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx93 Oregon governor.

aVI love Cam Newton's upside, and think he'll be an All-Pro caliber QB, but 21 TD's and 17 Interceptions and NFL Network has him as the 10th best Heisman Winner to play in The NFL.  Tebow was also on that list.  ESPN had a problem with Tebow but never mentioned how stupid it was that a guy who had a "decent" year throwing the ball, for a bad team is suddenly on a list that Tim Brown is not on.  I'm so tired of ESPN hyping things up and blowing them way out of proportion, for better or worse.

What makes it more effective in this regard?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn>I\u005c\u005c've also noticed that kill points are not often chosen as a primary \u005c\u005cnobjective at other events such as those that use the P/S/T format\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI can\u005c\u005c't speak for your experience, but most such events that I\u005c\u005c've seen have three objectives that are randomly allocated priority, making KP no more or less common than the others. Moreover, giving up KP is hardly the main disadvantage of the list; others rank much more significantly.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn> Note that roughly 75 percent of your army should arrive during the second turn\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn:| Math, huh?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn>Many of the units in my army are fast due to fleet so I can quickly redeploy much of my army as the game progresses\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnFleet doesn\u005c\u005c't make you any faster than anything else. Other infantry can Run, and tanks are flat-out faster than you thanks to being able to move 12" automatically rather than hoping for a good roll.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn> Imperial Guard armies heavily rely upon their Chimeras to protect their\u005c\u005cn scoring units so you want to prioritize targeting their transports...\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAgain, how do you actually kill transports? The lists you present usually feature very little AT. Your Zoanthropes and Trygon are the only units that will be able to consistently kill tanks.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn>At the end of the day though the results are the same\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94no major wins for \u005c\u005cnTyranids in fifth edition at any big events and I don\u005c\u005c't believe that is \u005c\u005cngoing to change while fifth edition is still in effect.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnEntirely true- at this point, I don\u005c\u005c't think that Tyranids are likely to take any major events, as too many factors are stacked against them. It\u005c\u005c's not impossible to win with them, but especially in environments where mech lists are common they will struggle. So do you really think that your own list is going to be able to achieve this- that you\u005c\u005c'll get "near perfect play and some luck" six or seven games in a row against other skilled generals to actually win a top spot?\u005c\u005cn

If it wasn't for US meddling Iran wouldn't even have an Islamic regime today. Like most other asinine things the US has ever done, their dictatorial plans backfired and caused the entire population of Iran to become hostile towards the US. And no one is regretting Mubarak's leave, only islamophobes like you do. As for the Taliban, the US government knew ***damn well how savage they were!!

Psychologically, you haven't left the theater yet, and are waiting for it to "finish". But you have (and will) in a few days come to grips with the fact that the movie is over, and that it was an empty, hollow piece of crap.\u005cn\u005cnAnd I just mentioned the core problem.

aVWell, it will be hard for Iran to claim Israel is responsible for one of these attacks. The purpetrator blow himself up and was cooperative enough to bring his passport to prove he is Iranian. These countries, especially India should rethink their relationship with Iran and cooperate with the sanctions. Buying oil from a state that sponsors terrorism will only lead to more problems for all. It does prove to anyone objective person or nation who had any doubts previously that the Iranian Regime is engaged in lies and deception, both in their involvement in terrorism and concerning their Nuclear Program.

aVi\u005c\u005c'm directing this comment only to the my fellow chelsea supporters.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cni for once agree with AVB. I think he should be strict with these big name players. If you are manager of this team you need to be strict. Avram Grant was too soft. Scolari too soft. Ancelotti in his 2nd year too soft. Are they still our manager... no. By time we have a manager that does things his own way and not play to their tune. At least he can (if he is sacked) say he did things his way, unlike the other scared managers afraid to touch drogba, anelka, lampard and Terry. Too long have these "big personality" players rule Chelsea. Remember in the 3rd season of Jose\u005c\u005c's reign when we lost the league to untd, early that season Drogba wanted to leave as he was sulking most of the champions previous 2 years and after Jose left, he sulked even more causing lot of negativity in the camp. OH and remember the champs final the sent off AND ANELKA\u005c\u005c'S MISSED PENALTY????? then the next year Scolari became manager he sulked even more and caused again negativity in the team. my point is when he doesn\u005c\u005c't sulk we win things. Players like Drogba, Malouda, Anelka, Lampard and Terry get paid lots of money per week to be professional and to give their best. CLEARLY AND THEIR SHOULD BE NO ARGUAMENTS FROM CHELSEA SUPPORTERS WHEN I SAY NONE OF THESE PLAYERS THIS YEAR ARE PERFORMING WELL ENOUGH TO BE IN 1ST TEAM YET THEY ARE DEMANDING FIRST TEAM ACTION. MALOUDA IS A WAISTE OF TIME, MONEY AND A PLACE IN THE TEAM. If this was Sir Alex instead of AVB then Man untd fans would have supported him, i\u005c\u005c'm asking, can we not do the same with AVB. I\u005c\u005c'm a big fan of Jose, but i think AVB is perfect for Chelsea as soon as the older players leave in the summer we will see the true CHELSEA.. We are set to buy Willian, Hazard, Christensen and Neymar. Players such as Paizon coming through next season. IMAGINE THE FOLLOWING SQUAD FOR NEXT SEASON.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn                                      TORRES - STURRIDGE- NEYMAR\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnMATA  -  ESSIEN- ROMEU -   RAMIREZ - PAIZON -MEIRELES -  HAZARD WILLIAN\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn                                     COLE- CAHILL-TERRY-LUIZ-IVANOVIC\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn                                                           CECH\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cncome on i know you are smiling as a chelsea fan and i know you are worried as a non chelsea fan.

aVCampbell, I urge you to stop cutting. One little relapse does not mean that you failed. Put the razors in the trash and haul the trash out to the curb until it gets picked up. You are better than that. Please get the support you need and deserve from CT or whoever you are comfortable with. And know that you have support here and are welcome to email me privately any time if you want to discuss things less publicly. Get healthy and then get out of the house to do something that is productive so that you'll feel better and have more self-worth. Whether that is looking for another job, walking the dogs, going to lunch with someone or volunteering - getting out and doing something is a great way to free your mind in a healthy way.

aVGood write up, but don't you \u005c\u005cnthink the north caused this on all of us. They are the ones who's quick \u005c\u005cnto rally round their own despite their evil hearts and devices. On \u005c\u005cnmonday, two muslims were sentenced to death by hanging for murdering a fellow\u005c\u005cn moslem, what all the Almajiris could comment is that Mustapha deserves \u005c\u005cnnot to die. Meaning: The Yoruba Muslim is not relevant as long as he is \u005c\u005cnnot Hausa-Fulani; those Mustapha killed are not relevant since they are \u005c\u005cnnot Hausa-Fulani even if they are Muslims. Please remind me - How many \u005c\u005cnnorthern leader or elite has raised a voice against the despicable, \u005c\u005cndivisive, corrupt and horrible governments of IBB and Abacha who broke \u005c\u005cnNigeria's virginity and destroyed her innocence? None, I suppose. As \u005c\u005cnlong as they are Hausa-Fulani, they can do no wrong! However, that is \u005c\u005cnnot to say I don't get some of your points. When Tambuwal and the \u005c\u005cneasterners plotted against a Yoruba speaker ship and trampled on any \u005c\u005cnidea of change in the senate leadership since it's still North/Easterner\u005c\u005cn thing, GEJ never gave a hoot. 4geting so soon it was the Yorubas \u005c\u005cn(Bakare and co) who protested and insisted that Jonathan be made acting \u005c\u005cnpresident. He also forgot the Yoruba-man (Obasanjo) who took all bullets\u005c\u005cn into his vests in other for him to emerge president against the \u005c\u005cnpower-deprived northern gluttons who would easily have devoured him. \u005c\u005cnIt's so convenient to forget, but we are waiting. Waiting... and I know \u005c\u005cnit won't take long before even the easterners begin the \u005c\u005cn'marginalisation' song all over again. And then, we will re-tell the \u005c\u005cnstory.

aVThere is a very fine line between disliking someone and going out of your way to actively belittle and harass someone because you dislike them. You're allowed to dislike people, but if you dislike someone to the point of submitting disgusting confessions about them - i.e., saying you don't doubt they'd snort someone's semen - that's pretty fucking heinous, and makes you no better than the person you dislike.\u005cn\u005cnIn any event, OP, you're not required to like everyone, and I don't think you should feel bad for disliking InRavenclaw.

A time is FAST APPROACHING where Canadians will unite and tell their \u005c\u005c'leaders\u005c\u005c' the quality of life and ethical standards in this country will not fall any lower, will not sink to new depths.

Any "but when WoW was released" arguments are simply asinine points.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAll in all, the game is what one would of expected years ago, but not today.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnOn a side note of how poorly they coded this game, it runs 2 .exe\u005c\u005c's for the same application, a huge no, no for video games because of the horrendous issues it causes, it simply looks like they cut corners and it is biting them on the butt now.

Some people may not have stopped and even talked to her.  Im sure where ever she is i know she is telling the same story about how an amazing guy called and helped her.  She may be wondering how you are.  I guess the best part of life is not getting credit but just doing good deeds and just moving on.  Very awesome Dan.

aVThat's why the MORE non-whites we let in OUR country, the more voting/politics/best interests of OUR country get biased/put aside. No matter WHAT, non-whites (and whites like us) will ALWAYS utilize group think. Us VS. Them/Us. OR. Them. No matter what! We are screwed. People don't think about these problems when discussing demographic change. It's not black and white (no pun intended) like most people perceive it to be. Most people think it will go one of two ways, good, or very bad. There is VAST amounts of grey area. Very complex cause and effect deals.

aV"If this is true, it\u005cu2019s hard to imagine that such a cavalier attitude towards a question like this one wouldn\u005cu2019t have infuriated liberals and Democrats if it had been exhibited by George W.

aV@Chesire @krayoncolorz @bpicampus Catholic priests will minister to soldiers who are killing people on the battlefield; that's not implicating itself in a practice that is morally anathema to it?  I really don't understand the Church's delicacy of conscience when it comes to human reproduction, and it's ability to suck it up and accept reality when it comes to things like war and capital punishment.

aVFor all the people saying "Well, thousands of people die everyday; suck it up, brat": yes, thousands of people die every day, but your mother passing only happens once in your lifetime.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 Yes, her family has money (I assume, but who really knows?), but having money doesn\u005c\u005c't mean you\u005c\u005c're equipped to deal with the sudden loss of a parent, especially when that loss leads the national news cycle for almost a week, and people are publicly airing your mother\u005c\u005c's and your family\u005c\u005c's dirty laundry. We don\u005c\u005c't know the life this young woman has had for the last 18 years, but it\u005c\u005c's safe to assume there were some rough patches; let\u005c\u005c's give her and her family some privacy in their time of mourning (I\u005c\u005c'm talking to you, media) and cut this kid some slack for not handling it well as we think we might.

aVTen Reasons Why Gay Marriage is Wrong\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn01) Being gay is not natural. Real Americans always reject unnatural things like eyeglasses, polyester, and air conditioning.\u005c\u005cn02) Gay marriage will encourage people to be gay, in the same way that hanging around tall people will make you tall.\u005c\u005cn03) Legalizing gay marriage will open the door to all kinds of crazy behavior. People may even wish to marry their pets because a dog has legal standing and can sign a marriage contract.\u005c\u005cn04) Straight marriage has been around a long time and hasn't changed at all; women are still property, blacks still can't marry whites, and divorce is still illegal.\u005c\u005cn05) Straight marriage will be less meaningful if gay marriage were allowed; the sanctity of Britany Spears' 55-hour just-for-fun marriage would be destroyed.\u005c\u005cn06) Straight marriages are valid because they produce children. Gay couples, infertile couples, and old people shouldn't be allowed to marry because our orphanages aren't full yet, and the world needs morechildren.\u005c\u005cn07) Obviously gay parents will raise gay children, since straight parents only raise straight children.\u005c\u005cn08) Gay marriage is not supported by religion. In a theocracy like ours,the values of one religion are imposed on the entire country. That's why we have only one religion in America.\u005c\u005cn09) Children can never succeed without a male and a female role model at home. That's why we as a society expressly forbid single parents to raise children.\u005c\u005cn10) Gay marriage will change the foundation of society; we could never adapt to new social norms. Just like we haven't adapted to cars, the service-sector economy, or longer life spans.

No, most of us law abiding citizens don't agree (quite rightly) with his choice of profession or the way that it has been shown in his floral arrangements but come on this is HIS funeral and HIS family and friends so why can't they say what they want and don't want even if it is really distasteful.

It is better to be judged by 12 then be carried by 6.  If a few of these punks would be shot by a citizen I believe the punks would think twice before attacking citizens.

aVSo I guess all the person had to do in the article was bitch constantly about a game that so many people have bitched about for ages and then they win the bitches over? Wow. As far as "Stop trivializing violence" goes. Why dont you stop sounding like a big ass c*** sucker and don\u005c\u005c't play games with violence then. I get so tired of all these holy sounding types that get touchy about video game violence.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn I\u005c\u005c've seen Blood Diamond a dozen times with the kids killing and getting killed and it doesn\u005c\u005c't even phase me one bit only because its not real, sure there is an emotional sense there but not enough to make me write to Hollywood saying gay sh*t like Stop trivializing violence because its disgusting. Why does a game have to tone it down when movies don\u005c\u005c't? I\u005c\u005c'm not defending COD in the slightest, and that\u005c\u005c's because I don\u005c\u005c't really care about the game. But when I read the headline of the article I was curious to see what others were going to say, but I knew hands down it was going to be an attempt to throw punches at a series that has sold a lot of copies already. All I can say is, it doesn\u005c\u005c't matter how "YOU" feel when every other gamer that plays the game probably can just deal with the game no matter if it changes or not.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn Sitting on your overgrown ass complaining about a game being this and being that just because you don\u005c\u005c't like it is stupid as hell. I hate JRPG games and why I also hate Anime with a passion because I can\u005c\u005c't stand cute crap, I hate that overly sensitive BS with the characters, I don\u005c\u005c't like Japanese music either unless its instrumental War drums or something out of Samurai Warriors or Kessen where it doesn\u005c\u005c't begin and end with a stupid Asian chick trying to sound like shes an innocent little annoying 11 or 13 year old...I hate high pitch whiny sounding voices too and no Japanese voice acting does not mean better over American voice acting because it still sucks regardless. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBut I don\u005c\u005c't go near the stuff (even though my brother plays JRPG games a lot, and that means I can\u005c\u005c't really escape it when we\u005c\u005c're both in the same room and I\u005c\u005c'm studying while he\u005c\u005c's just playing his sissy games). The fact still stands that I don\u005c\u005c't INTENTIONALLY go near things I hate just so I can whine about hating it like COD haters constantly go near Call of Duty to claim that they hate the game when its easier to just simply stay away from it, don\u005c\u005c't buy it, try to pretend like it doesn\u005c\u005c't even exist. I will not lie to anybody. I like violence in my games. People that walk around with a d*ck up there ass crying foul about CGI characters dying and getting hurt probably scream when the doctor comes at them with a needle. As far as Call of Duty having to change goes. Well, that depends on whether or not a lot of people want it to change, and not just the people that bash the game on a consistent basis either. I\u005c\u005c'm talking about people that really feel or believe it should change a few things and have accurate reasons why. Just simply saying "COD is for 13 year olds and needs to change this or that"...If anything the COD players are the ones that should change.

aVI am a sales arborist in the DC Metro area. I have grown all too accustomed to the status quo set by Service Magic. As a credentialed and educated professional in my field it has become quite disturbing to work with the environment that Service Magic has created, i.e. a false sense of qualification of vendors to the consumer. I have spoken with many arborists from other firms in our region and all say the same thing. This could have been a beneficial service, but without demanding proper insurance and credentials from its vendors it simply becomes a means for the unlicensed and uninsured vendors to gain business they are not qualified to perform. This also leaves the qualified professionals, such as myself, without a fair cost comparison to offer our clients. The fact of the matter is, companies pay tens of thousands of dollars a year for proper insurance, not to mention the cost of education to aquire proper credentials. Service Magic comes along and opens up an outlet for those who have not performed their due diligence in aquiring these necessary benchmarks to practice their craft to be solicited to the masses as "qualified vendors". It\u005c\u005c's a shame and has become a menace to the integrity of my profession and those of us who have worked hard and payed countless dollars to make ourselves a true qualified vendor. My hope is that the people at Service Magic make immediate change in their qualification of vendors.

aVTo anyone bothering to evaluate Obama on his words and actions, vs. having someone else do the evaluation for them, he has never been anything but a pragmatic centrist.  The problem with such a position is that the extreme left will claim a betrayal to an ideology never subscribed to, the extreme right has made it crystal clear that not only do they consider liberals sub-human criminals but they have no patience for moderates of any stripe, and the overwhelming majority of people who are in the middle are not political wonks and don't have the time necessary to try and figure out the truth through all the spin so they are unfortunately left with the impressions of whatever sensationalist press last got their attention.

aVThe general population may be, but I think that the people in the NAR know exactly what is in there, and are advocating for it. These are the same people who think gays should be executed, atheists should have their citizenship revoked, and that the first amendment means you have the freedom to choose what type of Christian you want to be. They say they want to return us to a "Christian Nation" and that we need to base our laws on Old Testament Biblical Law. Go back and look at some of the stuff Bryan Fischer, Mike Huckabee, Michele Bachmann, and Sarah Palin have both said and endorsed. Look at some of the statements Rick Perry\u005c\u005c's advisers have made, and things Jim DeMint has said. They feel they have been commanded to take over government, the entertainment industry, the church, etc. \u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0These people have more influence than they should, and enough to be dangerous. Their followers are probably naive when it comes to what their leaders are advocating and will continue to push their agenda without considering the consequences. Some of the Tea Party have tried to introduce legislation to pass personhood amendments (which are bad enough) but also to charge women with felony murder if they miscarry but are unable to prove they had nothing to do with it. I have no idea how they would go about autopsying an 8 week old fetus, but women would be guilty until proven innocent. Please see last part of post in regards to capital punishment. This is what DeMint and crew advocate.

Doctrinal leaders (notably Rushdoony, North, and Bahnsen) call for the death penalty for a wide range of crimes in addition to such contemporary capital crimes as rape, kidnapping, and murder. Death is also the punishment for apostasy (abandonment of the faith), heresy, blasphemy, witchcraft, astrology, adultery, "sodomy or homosexuality," incest, striking a parent, incorrigible juvenile delinquency, and, in the case of women, "unchastity before marriage."According to Gary North, women who have abortions should be publicly executed, "along with those who advised them to abort their children." Rushdoony concludes: "God\u005c\u005c's government prevails, and His alternatives are clear-cut: either men and nations obey His laws, or God invokes the death penalty against them." Reconstructionists insist that "the death penalty is the maximum, not necessarily the mandatory penalty." However, such judgments may depend less on Biblical Principles than on which faction gains power in the theocratic republic. The potential for bloodthirsty episodes on the order of the Salem witchcraft trials or the Spanish Inquisition is inadvertently revealed by Reconstructionist theologian Rev. Ray Sutton, who claims that the Reconstructed Biblical theocracies would be "happy" places, to which people would flock because "capital punishment is one of the best evangelistic tools of a society."The Biblically approved methods of execution include burning (at the stake for example), stoning, hanging, and "the sword." Gary North, the self-described economist of Reconstructionism, prefers stoning because, among other things, stones are cheap, plentiful, and convenient. Punishments for non-capital crimes generally involve whipping, restitution in the form of indentured servitude, or slavery. Prisons would likely be only temporary holding tanks, prior to imposition of the actual sentence."

aVThe Keynsian economiic imperatives are obvious to almost all economists and the vast majority of lay persons who have read an introduction to economics course.\u005cn\u005cnHowever, the plutocrats who make the decisions have material self-interests that are inconsistent with the general prosperity. For example, corporations owned by the plutocrats are acquiring foreclosed and distressed real estate all over the globe for small fractions of their former prices. Also, the corporate plutocrats are breaking the already fractured bones of organized labor everywhere from Wisconsin, to Canada to Greece. \u005cn\u005cnSadly, the plutocrats and their authoritarian allies in the clergy have so successfully degraded public education that there now are hundreds of millions of devotedly ignorant and sanctimoniously stupid voters who sincerely believe it is more important to keep homosexuals from kissing than it is to feed the world's children.\u005cn\u005cnDemocracy is dying all over the globe and soon we will revisit the desperately hate-driven politics of the 1920s and 1930s.

One conservative estimate is that gasoline prices will increase 6-9 cents more per gallon.\u005cnIn another outrageous example of an unreasonable regulation, the EPA fined refineries $6.8 million in 2011 alone for failing to blend cellulosic biofuel into gasoline and diesel. The only problem is that cellulosic biofuel isn\u005cu2019t even commercially available, despite the government\u005cu2019s mandate that we had to use 6.6 million gallons of it last year.\u005cnWorse, EPA is mandating that refineries use 8.6 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol this year\u005cu2014regardless of whether or a single drop of cellulosic ethanol is produced."\u005cn\u005cnhttp://cnsnews.com/blog/thomas-pyle/overzealous-epa-killing-refineries-hurting-american-consumers\u005cn\u005cn\u005cnobama's regulators are killing jobs helter skelter!\u005cn\u005cnobama=WPE

aVRandal, regarding your first paragraph above, what articulett said!\u005cn\u005cnRegarding you second paragraph, you really don't see what you are forced to do here, do you? It's what I see you arguing on your blog and in our co-written book. You stretch things to suit what you believe. You use improbabilities to conclude a probability. You do this all of the time, almost in every case. \u005cn\u005cnTake my speculation that most non-believers, especially former Christians, have heard many of the \u005cnthings you say in this book, but most Christians have not considered the \u005cnthings I say in it. (that's how I meant the sentence per aritculett).\u005cn\u005cnFirst off, when it comes to FORMER CHRISTIANS we were scared to death to seriously doubt our faith. We were scared because of the threat of hell if we get it wrong. You probably do not understand this. When the time comes for you to seriously doubt your faith you will understand it. At that point you must be convinced your faith has almost no probability to it at all in order to reject it, since that is the\u005cxa0 point where Pascal's Wager has no more force on us. So we investigated it thoroughly, most of us. The more educated we are in our faith then the more we must investigate it. So it's more likely what you have said in our book will be things most former Christians have considered before.\u005cn\u005cnI have a mountain of anecdotal evidence for this as well. Almost every Christian I have spoken to always learns something from me and I have learned little or nothing from them. This scenario repeats itself every time I have a disunion with a Christian, and can be seen from the responses to my blog over a six and a half year period. I teach them. They do not teach me.\u005cn\u005cnWhen it comes to NON-BELIEVERS in general studies have shown that non-believers know more about the Bible than Christians. That's evidence, baby. The probability therefore\u005cxa0 that non-believers will not learn as much from you in our book is more likely, than otherwise.\u005cn\u005cnSo these speculations of mine have evidence for them. Evidence. That's what I'm talking about, here, there, and in our co-written book. You must skirt it at almost every step in order to believe. \u005cn\u005cnAnd you provide some evidence that this is what you do here. You compared the probabilities of my speculations with predicting how many people will get rained on next February 18th. I did not say how many believers would learn more from me than you, nor did I speculate how many skeptics would not learn as much from you. I only speculated than MOST believers would learn more from me. Most, as defined as above 50%, minimally. You however compared my speculations with prediction of how many people would get rained on next February 18th. That's asking someone to specify a mathematical number of people who will get rained on. You are also asking for the impossible, or the near impossible, since no one can predict what the weather will be like on one part of the planet seven months from now (charitably assuming that's your comparison rather than asking someone to predict the number of people who will get rained on globally). w\u005cn\u005cn*ahem* there is absolutely NO comparative parity here at all.\u005cn\u005cnThis is what I see you do all of the time.\u005cn\u005cnThe unfortunate thing is that I have to spend 15-20 minutes explaining this to your deluded mind. That's a waste of your mind in my opinion, a waste of an otherwise bright mind who would never use it in like this in any other area of life except when it comes to your faith.\u005cn\u005cnNot only that, but I predict you are not done defending this utterly ignorant comparison.\u005cn\u005cnYou do realize that I've stopped wasting so much time blogging because of Christan like you, correct? Your reasoning abilities when it comes to your faith is just that bad, sorry. I have no hopes of convincing you jsut as I have no hopes of convincing a leader in Scientology. You cannot be argued out of your faith because you were never reasoned into it in the first place.\u005cn\u005cnThere is only hope for others.

aVDidn't take you any time at all to try to turn a solemn day into another attempt at racial conflict, did it?\u005cn\u005cnThe Facts:The earliest known evidence of\u005cxa0Decoration Day observance goes back to various women's auxillary groups in the North and South, when ladies organized events to honor their war dead by decorating graves. The earliest recorded event took place on April 25, 1866 in Columbus, Mississippi when a group of women formed an association to decorate the graves of civil war soldiers, starting with those who died in the Battle of Shiloh.The towns of Macon, Georgia, Columbus, Georgia, and Richmond, Virginia all claim to be the birthplace of Decoration Day, having first celebrated it in 1866. The town of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania claims to have celebrated the first Decoration Day in 1868. Carbondale, Illinois claims to have celebrated it first on April 29, 1866. In all, some 25 cities claim to be the birthplace of Decoration Day, most of them in the South.To settle the dispute, President Lyndon Johnson issued a proclaimation in 1966 naming Waterloo, New York to be the official birthplace of Memorial Day.

aVJoJo,\u005cnYou are absolutely inviting Obruny to get on my case again for using "we". \u005cxa0But this is the kind of thinking I would put into a petition project, which, after all, are plural in nature.\u005cn\u005cnHere are my rough thoughts around "how to":\u005cnI recommend we wait til we hear the [probably] disgusting outcome of the Security Council meeting today. \u005cxa0Are they still meeting, or did they just go away, without bothering with any action? \u005cxa0 I have not heard that yet.\u005cnWe all first need to read the "how to" instructions to design a good petition.\u005cnhttp://www.avaaz.org/en/petition/how_to_create_petition/\u005cn\u005cnI have not read it yet. But it addresses logistic realities of petitions.\u005cn\u005cnWe would need a bit of a discussion of what text we want. It has to be very cogent.\u005cnYou have seen my very roughly written theme.But maybe a much simplified call to boycott the Russian 2014 Olympics would be best.Consider how THAT could be publicized at the London Olympics by the British Syrians!\u005cn\u005cnOr a call to cancel the Russian Olympics altogether. That would go to the Olympic Committee, which is a dead end. \u005cxa0They have no objections to tyrants. "They is one".\u005cn\u005cnBut we would have to decide who we want to deliver the petition to, and that shapes the wording of the\u005cxa0\u005cnAnd it would be good to consult with a few other key people. \u005cxa0We would not need to have unanimity, but we would need to know if "Syrian Campaigns" and others are thinking of doing the same thing. \u005cxa0The situation now in Syria is such, so close to the tipping point, that every little project can help leverage the collapse of the regime.That is why I signed the petition to refer Assad to the ICC, even though I would prefer to simply lynch him in the streets of Damascus and display his body in every town of the land. \u005cxa0Just my initial thoughts.\u005cxa0Grammar pickers please note that I used the modal subjunctive "would" and "could", to indicate possibility, not fact.

aVLet me try again.  The mother did not know.  Had no clue.  In fact, she even tried to keep the family together with this piece of garbage whom she loathed because she thought it was in the girls' interest.  NO ONE knew except CHRIS, the victim.\u005cn\u005cnNO One.  She herself couldn't connect the many dots, the effects the incest was having on her own behavior.  This is the dark side, Erin.

How is that right? Why should i be bashed on here b/c i have an opinion? I never said anything about UGA needing to sign 3* players or signing s/one just to sign them.

aV@jsdavis13 True. You'd think that the Christians who are so hell bent into forcing religion into public life would be using it to do the things Jesus talked about. He never said a word about gays or when the soul enters the body. He spent all of his time hanging out with prostitutes and the poorest of the poor telling rich people it would be very hard for them to get into heaven. Remember the sermon about when I was hungry you did not feed me, because what you do for the least of these you also do unto me? I don't much think Jesus cares how we care for each other, as long as we do. A hungry kid doesn't care if dinner came from food stamps or from a loving donation. My guess is he would not think highly of a society that leaves issues like hunger and medical care to the whims of its donor class.

He should have taken the 1 year ban originally set, but no, Spain had to cover it up, and the president even got involved to get it overturned. Seems not just Contador wants to win at all costs, Spain too! Contador knew Schleck chain had come off, but broke the unwritten rule.

The good news is they have such a candidate. The less good news: Scott Walker isn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t running for president. He\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s running to hang on to his job as governor of Wisconsin.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWalker is the target of a recall effort funded by national labor unions. Why? Reforms he made to balance the budget have dramatically diminished the influence of public employee unions. If not reversed, these reforms will inspire similar efforts across the country, and the outsized power of public sector unions will finally be reined in.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe election in Wisconsin\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94which will happen in late spring or summer\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94could have a profound impact on the 2012 presidential race, with the winning side emerging from the battle organized and energized in one of the most important swing states this November.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWalker came to office in the Republican wave of 2010. He inherited a mess. Under his profligate predecessor, Jim Doyle, state government had operated almost as a slush fund for public employee unions. Giveaways to teachers and others put the state on an unsustainable fiscal path, so Doyle raised some taxes and threatened to raise others. He raided a state fund set up to cover medical liability, essentially stealing contributions doctors had made to the pooled account. The Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled against that pilfering, but the money had already been spent. Even after budget gimmickry that would make Fannie and Freddie blush, the official deficit was $3.6 billion.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnJust over a year later, Walker and the Republicans in the state legislature have nearly eliminated the deficit. For the two-year budget cycle, the state will show a $143 million shortfall because the stagnant economy has resulted in lower tax receipts than had been projected. But the shortfall is for the first half of the cycle; Wisconsin will run a surplus in the current fiscal year. And Walker said last week that he will eliminate the remaining shortfall without raising taxes. It\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s a credible claim. He reduced the deficit without raising taxes. In fact, one of his first moves upon being sworn in was to cut taxes on businesses. His subsequent reforms have allowed property tax receipts to go down for the first time in years\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94by some $47 million.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe recall vote Walker faces comes because of these results. The key to his success was his restructuring of health and retirement benefits for many state employees, asking them to contribute 5.8 percent of their salary to their pensions (up from 1 percent or less) and to pay 12.6 percent of their health insurance premiums (up from 6 percent or so).\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnEven some of the governor\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s harshest critics acknowledged that such changes were reasonable. \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cWalker is right about one thing,\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d wrote Eugene Robinson, liberal columnist for the Washington Post. \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cWhen it comes to pensions and benefits, public workers in Wisconsin have a sweet deal. .\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx89\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx89.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx89\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx89. It\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s easy to see why the average private-sector worker in Wisconsin\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94probably paying upward of 25 percent toward health insurance costs and struggling to tuck away something, anything for retirement\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94might agree with Walker.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWalker understood from his years as Milwaukee County Executive that such changes could not occur without dramatic reforms of collective bargaining for public employee unions. So he proposed them, and Republicans in the state legislature made them law. The reforms also ended compulsory union membership.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe unions correctly understood these changes as a mortal threat. Without compulsory membership, unions would lose a major source of funds. And without the ability to bargain collectively for benefits, the unions would lose their most compelling argument to convince public employees to contribute a chunk of their income\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94in many cases more than $1,000 per year\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94for the privilege of membership. So they took to the streets in massive numbers and pressured the Democrats they\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99d elected to do everything possible to sabotage Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s plan. Democrats in the state senate fled to Illinois. Protesters occupied the state capitol. The fight captured national attention for months in 2011.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe unions lost that battle, but they did not give up the war. They launched an aggressive effort to recall several Republicans in the state senate with the hope of reversing the reforms before it became clear that they were working. They spent heavily\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94an estimated $30 million\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94and lost again.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnMeanwhile, the results of the changes began coming in. In Milwaukee, the reforms saved some $11 million, an embarrassing windfall for Democratic mayor Tom Barrett, who had predicted that the city\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s structural deficit would \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cexplode.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d Localities across the state have seen similar savings. There is no disputing the central fact of Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s tenure as governor: His reforms are working.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThat\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s a huge problem for the public employee unions as they try to convince Wisconsinites that the man responsible for this dramatic turnaround should be recalled. So they\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99re focusing on two other issues: his 2010 campaign and an investigation into the activities of former Walker employees.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnTheir first complaint is that Walker didn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t campaign on the specific changes he would make to collective bargaining. Walker concedes that there is some truth to the claim. He wasn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t more specific, he says today, because he did not yet know exactly how he would make the changes to collective bargaining. But Walker is conceding too much. He didn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t provide a point-by-point proposal to restrict collective bargaining, but it was no mystery that he\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99d make dramatic changes. Ryan Murray, a top policy adviser to Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s 2010 campaign, made that clear to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel in describing the changes to public employee health and retirement benefits. \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cThe way the proposal would work is we would take the choice out of the collective bargaining process,\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d he said in comments published on August 29, 2010.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnDid that mean an end to collective bargaining over benefits? The reporter certainly seemed to think so. \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9c[Murray] said school districts often have some of the most expensive health benefits in Wisconsin and could receive cheaper insurance through the state if they didn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t have to negotiate with unions about who would insure their members.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d Christina Brey, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the leading teachers\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 union, had the same understanding. \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cOur members oppose taking away their rights to collective bargaining, so they would definitely raise their voices against it.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d Another teachers\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 union, the American Federation of Teachers, distributed flyers to its members warning that Walker would \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cvoid parts of labor contracts\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94something that couldn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t happen without changes to collective bargaining laws.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIn light of the success of Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s reforms, complaining about what he said in 2010 seems unlikely to win many votes. So Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s opponents want to change the subject. Last week, Mike Tate, chairman of the Wisconsin Democratic party, toured the state in an attempt to link Walker more closely to an investigation of some of his former employees. Here again, Democrats have resorted to distorting reality in order to smear Walker.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThere are two separate issues. In the first, a woman who worked for Walker when he was Milwaukee County executive was found posting political comments on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s website during working hours. She resigned in May 2010.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe second involves two former Walker employees who allegedly stole money from a veterans\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 organization that worked with the county on an event held at the Milwaukee County Zoo. John Chisholm, Milwaukee\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s district attorney, has been investigating the claims for 20 months. There is no indication Walker knew about the employees\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99 activities, much less condoned them. Chisholm has said that Walker is not a target of the investigation\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94which only exists because Walker requested it when he was presented with the facts.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSome Wisconsin Republicans, pointing out that Chisholm is a Democrat and highlighting the steady stream of leaks coming from his office, are growing concerned that the investigation is a political witch hunt, designed to bloody the governor before voters cast their ballots. Walker, for his part, says that he believes Chisholm is an \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cearnest\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d prosecutor who will conduct a fair investigation. That\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s probably overly generous.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe coming battle for Wisconsin will be a difficult fight for Republicans. Democrats have shown that they are willing to do just about anything to win. Unions are fighting this battle as if their very existence depends on a victory\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94and it might.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnFor conservatives, the fight is about much more than one man in one state. A Walker defeat would send a message that political courage does not pay and political thuggery does. Walker doesn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t like to talk about the effect the past year has had on him and his family, but it hasn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t been pleasant. He has been subjected to numerous death threats. His wife, Tonette, has been verbally assaulted more times than she can count. His two teenaged boys have been targeted on Facebook. His modest home in Wauwatosa has been the site of several union protests. Last month, a protester outside Walker\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s State of the State speech told State Senator John Kleefisch that his wife, Lieutenant Governor Rebecca Kleefisch, is a \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cf\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx94ing whore.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWalker has been willing to endure these attacks to turn his state around and defend conservative principles. Conservatives should rally behind him.\u005c\u005cn

aV....From: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971) [CONTINUED]\u005cn.....\u005cn "There are at least intimations in the decided cases that a dual national constitutionally may be required to make an election. In Perkins v. Elg, 307 U. S. 325, 307 U. S. 329 (1939), the Court observed that a native-born citizen who had acquired dual nationality during minority through his parents' foreign naturalization abroad did not lose his United States citizenship "provided that, on attaining majority, he elects to retain that citizenship and to return to the United States to assume its duties." In Kawakita v. United States, 343 U.S. at 343 U. S. 734, the Court noted that a dual national, "under certain circumstances," can be deprived of his American citizenship through an Act of Congress. In Mandoli v. Acheson, 344 U. S. 133, 344 U. S. 138 (1952), the Court took pains to observe that there was no statute in existence imposing an election upon that dual nationality litigant.\u005cn\u005cnThese cases do not flatly say that a duty to elect may be constitutionally imposed. They surely indicate, however, that this is possible, and, in Mandoli, the holding was based on the very absence of a statute, and not on any theory of unconstitutionality. And all three of these cases concerned persons who were born here, that is, persons who possessed Fourteenth Amendment citizenship; they did not concern a person, such as plaintiff Bellei, whose claim to citizenship is wholly, and only, statutory."

aVAnother reason to vote for Newt Gingrich and defeat R.I.N.O.! Desperate struggle to get Mitt Romney elected indicates they and their comrades do more than lean left. Some, wholeheartedly endorse/embrace Socialism. Maybe, not to the dedicated, robotic extent Barack Hussein Obama was sworn into office with the charge -fundamental transformation (destroy from within) of America. He and his fellow would-be-dictators think they can trample our Constitution at will. He has tried as hard as he could to fulfill PC/Socialist agenda. However, God holds America and HIS sparrows in the palm of his hand. They need to check with fellow despots who have challenged America\u005c\u005c's resolve. They will be impeached! America will never be destroyed. America\u005c\u005c's enemies will destroy themselves, first e.g. With all the "supposedly" well placed bombs in India, etc. to blow Israeli diplomats to smithereens only MANAGED to "injure" a couple - as opposed to Israel\u005c\u005c's "absolute" success -if true- in blowing to smithereens any nuclear scientist(?) they target! When I hear Iran BS about closing the Straights, blah, blah, blah, I think of Saddam Hussein and his "mother of all wars" to be unleashed, if America even thought of attacking! American marines dug his rear end out of his gopher hole; I read somewhere that Saddam\u005c\u005c's head popped off t his hanging when trap door was sprung; to add insult to injury; pour salt in open wound: Petraeus set up US military compound in his mansion compound with all its gold leaf.

aVLet me give you a view from Brazil.  Consenting adults, within the law can have any relationship they choose. Government cannot legislate morals. Captain Boycott, of the British Military occupying Ireland, with vast powers of the kingdom St his disposal, got rid of his wife of decades, to have a carnal relation ship to a very young lass, well. The community simply decided, to turn thier back when ever he appeared, close thier pubs, stores, once he pulled up. 'Shunned' Thus the word 'boycott' enter the english language. The point, if you feel that strongly, organize a society response to his films and other work, independent of it's intrinsic qualities. \u005c\u005cnHere in Brazil, there is a culture of deflowering teens and preteen girls, by the nationals here, for foreigners they are sent to prison.\u005c\u005cnThis is often done by fathers and grandfathers, the patriarch of the family. Said to have originated in ancient Rome, the film BraveHearth made reference to first night, where the lord of the area do some form of this power sex on minors in thier dominion. West Virginia, comes to mind, as this power sex folklore is said to be in epidemic proportions, these daughters get deflowered in house, first, sound familia. Are you going to 'boycitt' the state of West Virginia? \u005c\u005cnClearly Morgan has crossed the lines, of our sensibilities, our Puritan morals, and our expectation of decency, so did George W. Bush,  with his Hurricane Catrina etc., and Bill Clinton with his oval office dick sucking, episode of his intern.\u005c\u005cnThese are/were  actual Presidents of these united States. Do you have the right to impose your morals on consenting adults within the law? We all have the answer to this? What freekie things are you doing?  Can you state, as I am now, none!\u005c\u005cnjob

When I wrote about Things Professors Do that Irritate Students (http://www.profkrg.com/things-professors-do-that-irritate-students), keeping students late was one of the main things students mentioned. Quite simply, one professor\u005c\u005c's self importance often leads to students being penalized in other classes.

Obama can blow smoke up the publics skirt all he want to but the S&P and other credit agencies are not going to be fooled in the least. They've already warned of another downgrade and why? Because they don't see ANY real progress being made on Obama's part to intellegently and pragmatically address the issue in a published\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0plan. And, the reason they haven't is because the president has no interest in cutting spending as long as he can borrow from China, et.al.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe only way out of this mess is with private business growth and if anything can be said of the last\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa03.5 years it's that if Obama is really really good at anything it's squashing growth. So, either we\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0choose austerity and growth this election or we reelect Obama and face it in bankruptcy. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWhat's going to happen to\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0defense and\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0social security and\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0medicare and medicaid and all the social nets\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0when Obama\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0can't borrow the money to pay for them?

aVAnd your point is that the heterosexuals have brought in a peaceful, loving and beautiful world? Read the news. Heterosexuals have brought the world to the brink of destruction.\u005cn\u005cnYour logic is off. What is there to "consider, or think deeply on"\u005cxa0 when a homosexual is born this way.\u005cxa0 When did you think and consider deeply about becoming a heterosexual (if you are)\u005cxa0 and then stand on the mountaintop to tell the rest of us how it's done? \u005cnTo drill into gays and lesbians that they are sick and perverted and shame them to death is a one way ticket to a Muslim country with Sharia law. You can pack your bags and go anytime.\u005cn\u005cnGet used the new world. It's not going away... unless the heterosexuals destroy it sooner than later.

Maybe just blatantly move him to Raw, so he can. And please don't mention Tensai. The guy is not ready to challenge Punk for the title and hopefully never will be,\u005cn\u005cn2. Ew, Big Show? Even when I used to despise Show for his booking, I would never say ew. Seriously, who says that?\u005cn\u005cn3. None of you guys really pointed out the fact that this is only falling in line for Jericho. He won't come back immediately. He is touring with Fozzy now and will be gone a lot of the summer. The only one who is hurt is Orton who we get to right afterwards.\u005cn\u005cn4. Wait, why are we talking about two newcomers getting their very first PPV match against the face of SmackDown? Sandow and Cesaro are not at a point that they should be wrestling against Orton. Miz would be a good choice if he weren't falling so far and so fast lately. I stand by Ziggler or Judas' idea of having Orton be the special guest referee.\u005cn\u005cn5. Raw had at least the Punk/Bryan segment. Also, when you say there is no tag team division, you seem to miss the fact that the division is in full rebuild right now. Everyone from the Usos to Darren Young and Titus O'Neil to Hawkins and Reks to the AW stable is stepping up and finding a place. In fact, the least fluid team right now might be the champions who still don't feel like a real tag team or a serious threat. As far as SmackDown vs. Impact, I agreed with the guys on Impact, but you guys are sometimes underscoring SmackDown which was very solid story-wise and especially wrestling-wise.\u005cn\u005cn6. Yeah, obvious the TNA move was positive while the Raw move is polarizing.\u005cn\u005cn7. Wow, a lot of Hogan lovers. "He made the show better." "Best mic work of his career." What? Hogan was great on the mic in the 80s and 90s. He has not improved. He has lost his wits and charisma for the most part. Laurinaitis plays his role to perfection, and he brought about the great Extreme Rules PPV. He is a long term storyline, taking over the company one step at a time. Hogan has not improved programming. The creative team has just come up with a couple good ideas since Hogan arrived. Sorry, but at least Laurinaitis doesn't have an easy replacement.\u005cn\u005cn8. Btw, Sean, you aren't ahead of me anymore. I went for a perfect 20 at Over the Limit putting me in clear first. Second, I see some of your points, and Shelley could work. I just think Morgan has to be the choice now. It could end up being wrong, but Shelley is a much less safe and much more long term choice.\u005cn\u005cn9. I stick by what I said. Sting shouldn't be wrestling any more. He doesn't have the skill or the presence he once had. He is just a symbol being hopelessly dragged around by TNA desperately.\u005cn\u005cn10. Wait, so no Angle then? Then it will probably be Sting. If not, people need to realize that Roode has feuded with Hardy already. He has feuded with Styles already. Basically, that means it is someone fresh like Austin Aries or Samoa Joe. Or it's Anderson who has been built to it. So I guess I'll say I hope it's Anderson over Sting, but it will probably be Sting.

aVHodgson was obviously rattled by the uproar about Ferdinand (which is a nonsense really), that he went and filled more than half the team with black players to prove that he's not a racist!

aVFrom: Rogers v. Bellei, 401 U. S. 815, 831-3 (1971)(a case involving statutory citizenship forfeiture, discussing dual citizenship/dual allegiance):\u005cn\u005cn"The Congress has an appropriate concern with problems attendant on dual nationality. Savornan v. United States, 338 U. S. 491, 338 U. S. 500 (1950); N. Bar-Yaacov, Dual Nationality xi and 4 (1961). These problems are particularly acute when it is the father who is the child's alien parent and the father chooses to have his family reside in the country of his own nationality. The child is reared, at best, in an atmosphere of divided loyalty. We cannot say that a concern that the child's own primary allegiance is to the country of his birth and of his father's allegiance is either misplaced or arbitrary.\u005cn\u005cnThe duality also creates problems for the governments involved. MR. JUSTICE BRENNAN recognized this when, concurring in Kennedy v. Mendoza-Martinez, 372 U. S. 144, 372 U. S. 187 (1963), a case concerning native-born citizens, he observed: "We have recognized the entanglements which may stem from dual allegiance. . . ." In a famous case, MR. JUSTICE DOUGLAS wrote of the problem of dual citizenship. Kawakita v. United States, 343 U. S. 717, 343 U. S. 723-736 (1952). He noted that "[o]ne who has a dual nationality will be subject to claims from both nations, claims which at times may be competing or conflicting," id. at 343 U. S. 733; that one with dual nationality cannot turn that status "into a fair-weather citizenship," id. at 343 U. S. 736; and that "[c]ircumstances may compel one who has a dual nationality to do acts which otherwise would not be compatible with the obligations of American citizenship," ibid.\u005cn ....           [CONTINUING]

aVI agree that parents are harming their kids with the sugar and processed food and factory-farmed animal products they feed them. HOWEVER, the USDA has a long history of CAUSING THOSE PROBLEMS, not ending them. I think this practice is foul and untrustworthy, like all government/police-state practices this country is adopting. And yet yes, parents need to wake up and step up their game if they want their kids to outlive them.....since this is the first generation that isn't expected to. And that is in large part due to diet and lifestyle, two things parents have 100% control over. So when I see parents get in an uproar over their right to feed their kids GARBAGE, because that lunch technically is NOT healthy,\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 it is really sad and I feel sorry for the kids. Not trying to be an ass here, but nobody likes the truth....

aVOBFan.\u005cxa0 Why are you on this board??\u005cxa0 If you don't know that the Senate brings up the bill, AMENDS it and then votes on it, you really should be on the cartoon board not here.\u005cxa0 But do not feel bad, most people that support OB are just as dim as you are.
p7131
aVNumber one, don't fret over weak Republicans.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnNumber two, I have never seen people so pumped up for the election, they see the major error in voting for Obama and are chomping at the bit to correct that.Number three, simply vote the incumbent Republicans out, I have numerous ones in mind that I will send direct cash to their Republican opponents campaign.It doesn't even matter what these opponents are as long as they are verifiable in their intentions.We had a hoot with the last crop we sent in, looking for more bang for the buck in 2012.It takes multiple elections, so be it.Number four, please man, all caps is just lame.
p7132
aVI can't bash you on the fact you get to spend your time around (usually) attractive, (generally) unintelligent females (at least around here they are, usually give damn good head, though). However, most of the male cheerleaders I know are skinny SOBs, same with the chicks. Throwing a hundred and fifty pound dude in the air, or a hundred and twenty pound chick, is not the same as pushing/pulling around a three or four (or more) hundred pound barbell.\u005cn\u005cn\u005cnSo please, you've got what you do, we've got what we do. Don't act fucking superior and most of us wont either.

aV@Crissa:disqus LaRaza (The Race), NBP. Nation of Islam, Aztlan to name a few are very racist and very left wing. You guys are just scared to call out a black person or a hispanic for racism. I am not scared to call it like I see it. It is easy to attack whites because it makes you feel good about yourself, you think the minorities will like you if you attack whites too. Be freaking honest with yourself. This has to be one of your dumbest replies ever Crissa. \u005cn\u005cnI view the world through the eyes of a "Native American" as you liberals labeled us. All I see is a self loathing person who wants to feel good about herself and have others like her "because she cares". Still all I see is a person who sits on land once hunted and lived upon by the native peoples. How many thousands of Indians died so you can live where you live and feel good about yourself?\u005cn\u005cnYour second sentence makes no sense, because even my staunchest enemies never accuse me broad brushing. When I attack, I am very specific about my targets.

aVYou goofy Repub thugs don't have a clue, not the tiniest shred of a fact on how health care works in most other countries around the globe. The US is the only developed country without universal, single-payer or socialized medical care for all its citizens. Some systems differ, but all achieve near 100% access to a doctor and hospital at way lower cost than we here in The United States of America. In some countries, people pay some small amount per doctor visit, like a co-pay. In other countries, you are covered, no co-pay. In most countries, the option to have private health insurance is always an option. This gives the wealthy or well-heeded access to some private doctors who want to only see rich patients. Their choice. \u005cnBut no one, no mom, dad, child, uncle, aunt, grandma, grandpa, sister, brother, business associate, boss, garbage man, ditch digger, or nuclear physicist goes bankrupt from a disease or medical condition like here in the USA. You need not fear the collection agency coming after you because you fell and broke your arm and had no insurance. No insurance company denies your claim or drops your coverage after finding out you have cancer or heart disease or MS. Get it? \u005cn\u005cnWe are in the dark ages of medical care in the US and the Neanderthal republicans want to keep it that way because their wealthy benefactors in the giant Insurance-Pharma industrial complex like it that way. These craven business people who lust after profits like an alcoholic lusts for a drink, make huge boatloads of cash and mega profits off us and do not want that gravy train to stop.

aVsocaljim:<div><br></div><div>Nope, Kelly should stay and stick around if we go 8-4 or 7-5 IMO. With a new QB coming in you just have that excuse. So yes, there is an excuse. It's not like we have a 4yr starter coming in and last season was a 8-4 or 9-3 record. No high expectations at all. If we surpass them then fine but if we can get at least 8 wins under this schedule and new QB it will be a success.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>Now with USC. If you all dont win your Conference Championship Kiffan should be fired. No excuse why you all shouldnt flat out be undefeated and in the National Championship this year. With that being said. If you all dont win the Conference it will be a huge failed season.&nbsp;</div><div><br></div><div>GO ND!!!!</div>

aV@Ritual Reality No I am simply saying that back then a lot of people said stuff like this. Theyre old conservative dudes. It just isnt that way anymore. I am sure Pat Buchanan and GB senior talked smack on blacks, its just the way it was. Nothing to do with me or anything I belive in I swear, I am just stating the facts of a different time.
p7155
aVTrue, maybe he's deliberately being an assh*le as a self-promotional marketing gimmick, because he knows controversial views will get him attention. \u005cn\u005cnIn that case, let's screw his plan up by avoiding clicks on his articles, and spreading the word to others to do the same. That'll fix his red wagon - and it's looking mighty red.

aVYour Yellowstone Fly Fishing Report:\u005cn\u005cn.. The Madison River is enjoying consistent salmonfly action. This, coupled with a bit of streamer fishing, and the highly successful soft hackle swinging is drawing the neighbors to the holes of old. Not too much visitation, yet, from the pink and yellow shirt crowd.\u005cn\u005cnObsidian Creek and Indian Creek are high and clear. Fish right by the bridge at the Indian Creek Campground. Catch as many Brook Trout as you care to.\u005cn.. The Gibbon River in the big meadows is at bank, and has picked up just a hint of color,) - and the bank is just plain pudding... If you choose to fish here be careful on two counts: 1) soggy soil transmits vibrations very well, 2) be sure you know where the edge is. Small streamers will do the trick. A double drowned caddis will also work.\u005cn.. Down canyon on the Gibbon River you will have to look for protected water, and gentle feeding lanes. There is a bit more color, the discharge is up, and the fish are being very picky about where they are hanging out. On the other hand they are not picky at all about what they are eating. \u005cn\u005cnOn the other hand, for a change, the Firehole River, (after an early scare,) has enjoyed cooling melt water and has maintained a bank-full puddle so far.\u005cn\u005cnhttp://flyfishyellowstone.blogspot.com/
