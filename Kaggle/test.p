ROMNEY has a grasp of reality and the ECONOMY and the real world business experience to know what is needed to pull America out of the ditch and back on the highway of economic growth and lowering the national debt of which Obama has contributed more in 3 1/2 years than GW Bush did in 8 years. Unemployment is over 8% and GDP is less than 2% and Obama says the economy is doing just fine. He is in way over his head...it's called the Peter Principle.

aVI think I can encapsulate both your position and Gordon's in one phrase - " a recession of choice".\u005cn\u005cnThere is the (common) idea that it is possible for a government to "create wealth" ad infinitum by printing money and spending it.\u005cxa0 And there is another idea that you grow rich through hard work and\u005cxa0not through currency maniupulation.\u005cn\u005cnMy opinion is that people like yourself (and Gordon) are dangerous because you are very keen on spending money and not so keen on earning it.\u005cxa0 When you run out of all the borrowed money you are spending you will need to start "re-distibributing" all the earned value in society...

aVThere is a certain contrasting quality between judgments within the world view of the proponents of the war on cannabis and Christian theology. The "everything is toxic" philosophy embraced by the ONDCP toxicologists and controlling offices such as the FDA and DEA is the exact opposite of sound Christian theology [1,2], and the corollary truths built upon it are not Biblically founded, and can be proven to be Biblically incorrect. -And if it\u005c\u005c's not Theologically true, if it\u005c\u005c's not true in the Bible, than it isn\u005c\u005c't true at all [3]. No Bible believing Christian can accept any "toxicology" studies or reports from the ONDCP in good conscience, when they consider the axioms that were used to build their studies. Do Christians adhere to "scientific" theories about big bang and evolution? No, and we can also reject the observations of the ONDCP about cannabis on similar grounds when all things are considered in a clear systematic theology. One must "Test The Evidences" that come from outside Scripture. Scripture, tradition, and reason imply that all things are good, and that substance (such as foods and drinks) only becomes toxic in it\u005c\u005c's misuse, that is, in the uses that are not in order with the purposes God created them [4]. The Scripture\u005c\u005c's warnings against these philosophies are traditionally viewed as warnings about the Gnostics of the second century. It was a blending of Jewish, Greek, or Eastern philosophy with Christianity. These Gnostic errors are widespread, they appear century after century, and shows itself in many forms of religion, not merely in distorted forms of Christianity. In life application today, we can see that same Gnostic germ resurface in our society in the influence of modernism and postmodernism. The war against cannabis is a frightening illustration, in that it is successful in stifling Evangelism within the local Church, and not many Leaders recognize what\u005c\u005c's going on, despite the fact that it devastates the lives of millions in perdition. This ascetic teaching is unnatural, contrary to the constitution of the world as that has been arranged by a holy and wise Creator, and it is also subversive of Christian liberty. Nothing can be esteemed common or unclean without throwing a reproach upon the Creator. [5] To further discover the long term consequences of these unnatural teachings, we can observe the characterizations and acts employed in the war on pot have a resemblance to the warnings in Scripture regarding the signs of false teachers (which are directly linked to signs of the coming Rapture of Christ\u005c\u005c's church). The war on cannabis shares at least 2 key qualities as the Gnostics. In the presence of the negative implications of statements such as "there is no way to teach this to you in a brief, " and, "everything is toxic, there is no harmless substances. ", the Christian should be reminded that encouraging formalism and asceticism as the result of false teaching is traditionally known as the activities of demons [6]; and the acknowledgment of liberty of conscience in a free moral agent is the formation of evangelical theology- for this very reason the Reformers left the Roman Catholic Church! [7]. The binge drinking phenomena we see in the just say no generation, as well as the licentious rebellion in the 60\u005c\u005c's, is evidences of the "fleshly indulgence", or antinomian development that results from these ascetic teachings. [8,9,10]To summarize; The Christian world view and the ONDCP world view can be sharply contrasted. In the ONDCP world view, the Truth is "everything is toxic" and application is "just say no". In the Christian world view, the Truth is "God\u005c\u005c's creation is good" and application is "be ye sober". The Scripture provides us a sharper, more accurate understanding and response to the subjects of cannabis use in society than the secular drug use prevention community. And as Biblical passages are weighed and discovered as this more accurate Truth, it should bear witness that the Gospel message of Jesus Christ is Truth. We should lend thought to this greater spiritual Truth for which the Bible is compiled as evidence of; That Christ made atonement covering and salvation for our souls. "For God sent not his son into the world to condemn the world, but that he world through him might be saved. God publicly displayed him as the mercy seat accessible through faith, all have sinned and come short of the glory of God, but by grace are you saved through faith, and it\u005c\u005c's not of yourselves, it is a gift from God. For whosoever believes in Him will not perish. If you confess with your mouth that Jesus Christ is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised him from the dead, you will be saved."

I\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99ve got to hand it to all of you and especially Blagojevich, I am impressed, not only have you committed rape, and pillage upon \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cWe The People,\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d but some of them thank you for it, they even get on a bus, and spit on people I really respect for you as you put in place the very plans that will destroy them.  That\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s really impressive, Bernie Maddoff, has nothing on all of you. The lot of you could screw a hooker and convince her to pay for it!  Now, your God of Government is upset with you Mr. Obama, and frankly, while I may be impressed, he is not.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWhy is this so?  For one thing The United States of America is still here, chugging along with all the accumulated dead weight that liberal democrats have heaved upon her.  Government God is also upset that the people still have a voice, he doesn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t like that.  You, as his surrogate, should stop all free speech immediately; tell Kathleen Sebelious to issue another communiqu\u005c\u005cxc3\u005c\u005cxa9 threatening the CEO\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s of insurance companies with summary execution unless they place the blame for higher premiums on those that truly deserve it; breast cancer patients, and further, that it is wholly unsatisfactory that they should live another day - The God of Government commands it to you Mr. Obama, you will obey.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe bigger cheese is likely also upset at the Godless turn of events in God\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s country.  \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cI am the Lord your God . . . You shall have no other God\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99s before me.\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d  Boy, have you screwed that one up.  I imagine that is a big one with the man upstairs.  You see, God works his will through the faithful, and not those like yourself who pray to false Gods and bear false witness on a daily basis - you don\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t even know what the truth is anymore.    Hell, they even got you thinking you fight \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cterrorists\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d by killing one side of the same Arab coin.  Whose the fool Barrak, you, or me?  Don\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t answer that, we know the answer. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnWell in 44 days the God of Government is going to have another problem.  \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cWe The People\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d are going into those polls, and we are going to fire the first shots in the shape of ballots at your Government God, and we are going to put God back where He belongs.  If this crop of politicians falls for the God of Government, we will just do it all again, we will be relentless, \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cwe will not weaken or tire,\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d we were given the tools by our founding fathers and we have deployed them against you to good affect.

aV<blockquote>I mean, he\u005c\u005c's DEATH\u005c\u005c'S BOYFRIEND. </blockquote>\u005c\u005cnThat\u005c\u005c's actually the exact point to which I refer:\u005c\u005cnThanos abandoned his love and need to appease Death during <i>The Infinity Gauntlet</i>. This was clear in anything and everything Starlin wrote following it (starting with <i>Infinity War</i>, which makes it pretty explicit, and was the next writing to feature Thanos\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxb9), but boring, lame-o other writers couldn\u005c\u005c't be arsed to keep up and went, "What was his thing again...? Oh yeah, he\u005c\u005c's in love with Death!"\u005c\u005cnStarlin brought it up once after that, in <i>The End</i>, in which Thanos has clearly progressed far beyond that, but refers to her as his love all the same--though still in a way suggesting he had moved on, long ago, from pursuing this. She didn\u005c\u005c't appear at all in what was to be his ongoing series (until Marvel pissed Starlin off for good)--that is, until Keith Giffen took over for the last six issues of it.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI say this with love for Ron Marz (I\u005c\u005c'm a Kyle Rayner fan, even with his writing leading to an infamous comics-critical blog named for an event in *that* story...) and Keith Giffen. But everyone other than Starlin (including those two) tried to boil Thanos back down to a simplistic core: "He\u005c\u005c's the dude in love with Death!" Though, to be fair, Giffen and Marz at least had a handle on the tenuous nature of his villainy, and even that it was almost abandoned--indeed, Giffen supports his aim to prevent the destruction of the universe as he writes him.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBut no, he <b>was</b> the lover of Death. The same as he was once a Darkseid knock-off of sorts. The same as he once pursued power purely for power\u005c\u005c's sake.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0 But those things all changed. Each story Starlin put him through over time gave him more and more dimension--as he asked himself at the end of <i>Infinity War</i>: "And what now are you, Lord Thanos? Hero? Villain? Neither? Maybe just wiser."\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIt was shameful the way an extremely rounded character kept being sanded back down to two dimensions every time someone else got their hands on him...I actually got into a fight with the editor of <i>Annihilation</i> over this, who told me that the storyline of Thanos in said book was to prevent exactly what I hated: lame writers screwing the character up further (so I apologized).\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI grew up going "Oooh! So many characters!!!" when I first saw <i>Infinity War</i> on newsstands, but was taken in by Thanos and his peculiar character, which was neither good nor evil, nor even amoral or simplistically "grey" or antihero. Everyone turning him back into "Oh, he\u005c\u005c's in love with Death and wants to be with Death," was always such a waste of potential...\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxb9"Death has rejected me. Like it or not, Thanos of Titan is now one of the living. Life is change."

aVHoly cow!  I just woke up to the fact that if government has a "spending problem", maybe that spending could actually be put to work stimulating the economy!  The idea that if government doesn't invest AND business doesn't invest, that that will somehow grow the economy - it's laughable!  Boy, what a chump I've been!

aVMrRobP: I think this conversation honestly just boils down to a matter of opinion. I like Burton's Batman's too but i felt he changed so much as well to fit his gothic style. Just like Nolan changes a lot to fit his realism edge. I dont want ultra realism for all comic books i just feel it really works for Batman. Plus i like more mature movies and the darkness in this series really makes me believe that these people can exist out there. When i saw TDK, an aspect that made it so mezmerizing and great for me was that i can truly believe that a man like Ledger's Joker is out there somewhere, idk but it made the experience of that film so visceral. But that approach wouldnt work for Spiderman or\u005cxa0 Avengers or basicallly all other superhero movies. Nolan's Batman gives the audience something no other superhero movie can give. One that can honestly happen, and that makes it more fantastical in my opinion.

aV@james3012   really?? more name calling?? i would have never guessed it. what a sad little boy you must be. just because the big kids bully you at school doesnt mean you have to try to be some internet gangster because i promise you you are not scaring anyone. you must be a wh fan. once again you guys continue to prove my comments about no class no character true. maybe for now on that can be your clubs motto.... NO CLASS NO CHARACTER by the way your comment "Just be glad someone from Manchester actually has a career" doesnt really make much sense. actually it doesnt make any sense at all. but what else can we expect from dense people such as yourself and the other two i was talking to. keep supporting rubbish people who shouldnt be allowed to profit from the beautiful game. ok i will shut it because i know you are feeble minded so go back to your nintendo

aVYou say that Marriage is a divine institution. Let me just crack open my King James Bible here and see what it has to say. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIn Genesis 2:24, I must stone my bride-to-be to death if she is not a virgin on her wedding night. Also, can't marry outside my faith, so best put that on the books as a legal requirement for marriage.Deuteronomy 22:28-29, I could just rape a woman, pay her father 30 silver and she is compelled to marry me. Quick, we need to add exemptions to our sexual assault laws so that we allow for rapist-victim marriages.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI could follow in the footsteps of Abraham, Caleb, Jacob and Solomon and take concubines, as blessed by God.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnOR, instead of claiming that your biblical view of marriage is the ONLY justified view, you could allow for other interpretations in our laws. Such as equality and common sense.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0

aV@Bunny77@llindsay@jess1\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnGinie Sayles books are great! Have you read Sophia Nelson\u005c\u005c's book, "Black Woman Redefined."? She talks about how most BW\u005c\u005c's social circles are lacking and gives advice on how to expand them for professional interests.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI think expanding social circles and not self-segregating is one of the most important things BW need to do. There are a lot of BW that could be more advanced professionally, socially, etc. if they had better social and strategic circles. If we did we would see more BW CEO\u005c\u005c's, etc.

aVNovant, like so many other HUGE companies, WELCOMES the ability to cut the fat from their payroll. Due to the complete collapse of the economy, every single company FINALLY has the right to cut fat. Publicly, they say it's "the economy, we hate to lay people off, we will hire many back when we can." Privately, they are like "woohoooo!! we can FINALLY do it!!" They are now allowed to get out the HR files, go through sick leave, hr complaints, work-from-home "workers" that never get their work done....etc and they can pick and choose who gets laid off. The cream rises to the top. The bottom scum gets fired. You know, the way America USED TO be. They are lovin' it! Thousands of companies have rebounded well, and have TONS of cash on hand now that they have been able to trim the fat off their payrolls. Do you think even ONE of these companies will be "twice-bitten" and start hiring people back now that they see they can make MORE money with LESS employees??

aVOnce again Wilshaw is babbling away about things that are not in his job description. Ofsted's role is to inspect schools and they have failed to do this consistently. Their standard in social care is even worse.\u005cn\u005cnPerhaps we need to consider what Ofsted's role should be. \u005cnInspecting and publishing a report is clearly not working. It is not what Ofsted was set up for in the first place. Mission creep is a real problem for Ofsted. The large one-off cost for a\u005cxa0widespread inspection to identify and help schools has become an on-going and rapidly increasing cost.\u005cn\u005cnIf they are inspecting, they should also be advising and working with weaker schools. If the school does not improve, Ofsted should be held to acount.

aVWhere does it say that their actions were in the name of Islam? Where does it say that their crimes were anything to do with their religion or ethnic background. Non-Muslims commit rape and kidnapping, look at that Josef Fritzl from Austria a few years ago. He locked up his daughter for years and had children with her after raping her. Why do you seem to think that there's a correlation between their religion and their crimes?

aV@KottiKaDottiisthenameofGod:disqus That's what I find funny.. how people think that because I believe in God, that means that I am supposed to just stand there and take whatever people hand to me. No, I am not out indulging in petty arguments or living ANY kind way.\u005cxa0 If something were to come my way, it would be because they are LOOKING to cause me harm. My Bible tells me to protect my annointing with my life. =) That's why I feel comfortable calling you Uncle Tom. You are the "negro" who acts and thinks just as white folks would have you to.\u005cxa0 They used the Christian faith to make brothers and sisters submit... What people DON'T mention is that THAT is why they didn't want slaves learning to read and write. They might've read that Word and couped!\u005cxa0 It didn't happen because God has much BIGGER plans for people who have misused His teachings.

aVYou broke it down perfectly. I think they all rank equally in my book. However since I am an avid study of Ancient Alien theory that postulates humans actually have an artificial origin (not denouncing evolution, just suggesting something interfered with that process to "adjust" our evolutionary path), I find myself a tab bias in favor of Prometheus. Additionally I am also a sucker for the latest, greatest effects & tech concepts. So many of which I saw finally given a silver screen nod.

Everyone should be responsible enough to know that massacres should immediately be halted.<p>I\u005cu2019m sick of repeating the same news, same words, same sentences all over again. If everyone acted and stood in solidarity with the people of Syria, this would not have happened. None would have. I can barely dare to imagine the pain and fear these families underwent as they were watching each other being slaughtered. I cannot believe how much the children have wept and screamed before being silenced forever as the sharp knives slit their throats.<p>My people are not numbers. Just imagine how would you feel if you were in their place, victimized, torturered, then executed in the most horrifying means ever. We all deserve to live.\u005cxa0<p>Everyone must stop blabbering about the mistakes of our revolution, what do to, what not to do, what should happen to us, what should not\u005cu2026 You do not control it and you do not matter as this is none of your business. When the people are being bombarded and besieged, denied access to food, water, electricity, etc, no one will listen to you so stop trying to hard to convey your bloody political suggestions to a populace under fire.\u005cxa0<p>Act in the name of Humanity.

aVChristi... I hope somehow you do see this comment.  You are completely on target!!!  My three sons danced ballroom for years!!!  I KNOW.  You have Abbys number and she hates that.  She IS living through those girls since she is never going to be a professional dancer and because they have young, strong, beautiful bodies.... Which she clearly is envious of.   She hates that she cannot intimidate you. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI relate very much to your feelings as a mother and as a dancemom.   This is a difficult situation as a parent.  You are doing the right thing!!!  Abby has no boundaries... Quite literally.  She is trying to control everyone else, because she has clearly no personal boundaries whatsoever.   Our coach told us straight up that he does not want parents watching rehearsals because they won\u005c\u005c't be able to handle the harshness required.  And it is rough!!!!   But we win. Everything.   We even win on dancing with the stars.  Everytime.  We win.  The difference between Rick and Abby is simple: she is vicious and personally cruel.   It is unacceptable.  If she were a parent, childrens services would have had her kids removed.  Rick is tough at rehearsals without being personally vicious!!  Abby is destroying their psyche.  And poor Maddie will end up with PTSD because she clearly feels badly for the way chloe is treated.  It is so obvious!!  That even Maddie backstage feels terrible for Chloe.  Melissa would see that if she wasn\u005c\u005c't such a "mean girl" selling herself to pay for dance (talking about living through your kid!!  Wow.  She\u005c\u005c's a walking dysfunction.  Trust me Christi, you and Hollie would not be able to live with yourselves to act like she does to pander to Abbys insecurities.  She is a special kind of mess).  Melissa is far more nasty and catty about "Maddie is the best" than I have ever seen Maddie be.  Melissa acts as if it\u005c\u005c's her accomplishment!!  I don\u005c\u005c't see her out there dancing for hours! \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnYou have a very challenging situation.  Keep handling it with strength and dignity!!  What Chloe learns about life and handling difficult people, whom we all have to deal with, is what is most important.  Stand up for what you know is best for your daughter!!  And don\u005c\u005c't engage with any one else who makes an ass of herself.   Keep your focus on not allowing Abby to negatively affect Chloe.   But don\u005c\u005c't worry about the moms as much, unless they say it in front of or to Chloe.  If she is unaffected by it, do not engage them.   Jill is so freaking insecure because she can\u005c\u005c't buy enough goodwill to make Kendall a quality dancer.  She doesn\u005c\u005c't have core strength.  She doesnt have strong technique.  She is simply an immature dancer.  If the mom would put half the energy she spends bribing Abby into helping Kendall, she could become a stronger dancer!!!  Jill is a nightmare.  Let her live in that nightmare all by herself.   Let no mom speak with her for a couple of weeks until she can clean up her act.   Shut her out.   So that she does not affect you guys.  You all have enough pressure!! \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnNow.... The catholic school girl costumes for the bullying number.... First the irony was so rich!!!  And Abby is clueless.  Second, our girls had the exact same costume for a lyrical number.  My sons was just watching that number and I was livid!!!  We were at the emerald ball in LA (I love how Abby name drops LA and NYC all the time).  We are all over the country every single weekend and sometimes entire week.  We have ballroom teams and regular girls lyrical/jazz/tap type teams.  When these girls walked out looking like living child porn, the entire ballroom of adult competitors and professionals gasped.   It was repulsive.   The number had gyrating, overly sexual moves, with the girls doing spilt legs with their crotches aimed at the audience.   I about died!!  Did some guy turn this team into a living vignette of his favorite porno?!?  We did not have the fishnet stockings.  I would have loved the fishnets over the thigh highs our girls were wearing!!   I am very proud to see you moms stand up and say "No!! These are children!!"  I cheered when I saw you have such an impact!   Our teams moms decided to make it goofy so it would not get the reaction we got in LA:  after gasping when the girls walked on, there were no cheers, no clapping, dead awkward and uncomfortable silence!!  Broken up only by other gasps!   It was embarrassing.  Such bad taste level.  These are almost all Mormon children competing.  This was just atrocious.  I am hoping the dance moms learned something from watching you stand up for what is right. All our moms did was put swim googles on the girls to make it look more goofy.   It did work.   The short skirts, the little panties crotch aimed at the audience, and gyrating pre-teens looking like walking porn was not mitigated one bit by swim googles. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnCHLOE:  you are not snotty.  You have never exhibited a mouthy or cocky attitude.  That is Abbys projection on you.  Because if she had been born as pretty as you are and as talented as you are, SHE would be a total brat to everyone!!   So she assumes your a nasty bratty girl.  It is obvious to everyone watching how gentle and kind and sweet and generous you are!!!  You deserve to walk tall!!!  Every time Abby berated you, tune her out!!  Put her voice far away in the background and tell yourself, america is watching Abby make herself look like absolute jerk!!  And we all think you are an incredibly strong and elegant dancer!!!!  And phenomenal for your age.  I would not lie to you kid!!  You are phenomenal!!  I promise everyone sees that. Even Abby ;)  everytime she picks at you, she is doing it because she is so stinking jealous of you she can\u005c\u005c't stand it!!!   She will never ever be as beautiful and as talented and kind and wonderful of a person as you are.  Smile, because every snotty thing she says or does reveals her ugliness to us and shows everyone how terribly jealous she is of YOU!!  You are a remarkable young woman!!  And an incredibly strong dancer!   There is good reason for Abby to be so jealous of you!!  Everyone should ;)  who wouldn\u005c\u005c't want to be Chloe!!!  She is a fabulous person and a dynamic dancer!!   Abby can never take that from you.  So don\u005c\u005c't give it to her.  You are amazing!!

aVI think Kirchner needs to concentrate on her countrys ailing economy, and stop all this nonsense about the Falklands.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThis is all simply deflection to galavanise the Argentinian people, its why she constantly brings the subject of the Falklands up, because whilst the people of Argentina are focuses on the Falklands, there is less focus on the economic woes of the country.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIs this what she wants her legacy to be?  Plastic Surgery and nonsense about the Falklands???? \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnQuite how the UK sending a ship to the Falklands which they do so regularly be considered a risk to "international security" is laughable rhetoric of the lowest kind.  There is no danger from the UK ship so long as no-one starts anything against that ship or the Falklands.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnThe people of the Falklands have made it clear they want to be a part of the UK, so how about the Argentinians respect that and just move on?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAlso, if Kirchner is so disgusted with the \u005c\u005c'oppressive\u005c\u005c' nature of colonisation, will she now be making a concerted effort against other countries that have colonies and trying to claim those for Argentina?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnFind a new hobby Kirchner, maybe one that involves economic stability for Argentina might be a better use of your time.

aVDid you know the national average of same sex couples is .77. Not even 1% of the population according to the 2010 U S Census. So I ask why does the news media and entertainment industry try to convince us that being gay is OK. Why should we change the Constitution to include marriage between same sex partners?  Marriage is between one man and one woman.  Why should we amend our laws or the Constitution for less than one percent of our society. You can not legislate morality. Our teachers and professors should not be teaching morality.

aVThere is one Judge and He is over all, He is the one who calls sin what it is and tells us to repent of it. Homosexuality G_d calls it an abomination, it is detestable to Him and it should be to us.\u005cxa0G_d did not create killers, muders, rapists, pedophiles, lesbians, gays, transgender, adulterers, thieves, fornicators, etc. Your logic fails when you say that the Creator made them this way for a reason, that is an evil position to hold. We make choices in this life and what we become is all based upon our own individual freewill, no one forces them to become rebellious against G_d, they have done it to themselves. In your trying to have others accept evil to create peace what you are actually doing instead is creating chaos, because righteousness and evil rebelliousness cannot co-exist.

aVGessh, If you're going to debunk myths you can't do it only in the way you want. The Amercian Revolution was based on many different factors, slavery only one of them. Industrialism was also one of them. Many of our founding father's had slaves up until the time that Lincoln set them free.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnOh... and slavery was the white man putting the black man in the yoke of the plow? Sorry but blacks sold blacks into slavery, that is how the white people got them. But the truth does not end there. Whites and native americans were also slaves. If you are still disillusioned Africa still has a slavery problem with blacks are kidnapping blacks and .... selling them into slavery.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBlacks should get over slavery because you are not slaves, you have not been slaves. Those who were slaves, the ones who had a right to be pissed about it are now dead. Move on and concetrate on making the most out of your life that you can.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBlacks fighting for America? No I'm not one of those who thought they didn't fight until WW2 but I'm sure that many blacks don't know or refuse to acknowledgs that there were free blacks who fought for the south against the north. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI am not racist. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBut I am damn tired of someone expecting something because the color of their skin. When I was in high school a black boy came to me and said 'move over'. I replied 'No.' He went and told the vice principal that I wouldn't allow him to sit down because he was black. I only wish I had had the courage to speak up and say that it was because he was rude. Had he asked politely I would have shared my seat.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnDuring highschool I endure quietly being struck in the back of the head by black girls because I was white. I had to endure vicious teasing from them because I was white. To what civic group to I complain to to get justice for this?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI once worked in a video arcade where a young black girl grabbed a moving game and held on to it so that the alarm went off. She must have been four so I crouched down not to over whem her, talked softly and told her the game was ment to be hit with the mallet and she couldn't hold on to the pieces. Her father started screaming at me for correcting his child because she didn't know any better and threated to cause me physical harm. I had to run to my office while his wife tried to pull him away. Of course she didn't know any better that is why i explained how to play the game to her... and you call me racist?\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnI believe that black's still have problems because they don't want to let go of the excuse... 'if something doesn't go my way it must be because I am black'... not that you could have behaved better or worked harder... or just like the rest of us poor white folks... sometimes you just don't get what you want.

Though he's \u005c\u005cnpublicly condemned all forms of birth control and gay marriage, his only\u005c\u005cn reaction to the pedophile priest scandals was merely to issue a feeble \u005c\u005cnapology for 2000 years worth of pedophile church swapping, record \u005c\u005cnburying, and secret payoffs to families for not denouncing the church \u005c\u005cnpublicly. He never condemned the behavior and only started defrocking \u005c\u005cnpriests when the masses started to put intense pressure on him to do so.\u005c\u005cn Even so not that many priests were let go compared to what are likely \u005c\u005cnout there.

aVMaybe it's just me, but doesn't all of this seem kinda petty. I thought we, for the most part, were all adults here. It sucks to have somebody be a constant pest, but it's the internet. And I have never come across this person you speak of but I was bullied in elementary school for years and I just dealt with it, I never ran to tell the teacher. You just got to grin and bear it, chances are it's some lonely dip shit with mommy issues and being a dick is his way of dealing with it. If somebody calls you a slut, and you in your heart know that you aren't, why let it bother you. I'm not saying that what he was doing was okay, far from it.

aV@Jsfordays510\u005cxa0Can you please explain how Nike is killing the "game". I'm not challenging you, I just want to hear the theory. I Think Nike ID Is the only thing close to a game killer and that is because it eliminates the re-sellers for the most part. So It kills the commercial \u005cxa0re-seller game a little. I think its genius. Now people can get a shoe close to their own wants instead of buying a stale remake over and over( I bought plenty of remakes).

aVFloridachick - Your grandmom was smart and probably knew what she wanted.  But I'm afraid I also have a real-life example of someone who 'should' have invested the money and left it sitting there until she had adjusted a little and thought more carefully about how to manage it.  My MIL spent more money and did more foolish and costly things in the first six months she was a widow, than most people do in a lifetime.  She (and others) 'wish' she had taken the standard advice to let things settle out for a year before making any major changes. She'd very much like to have some of that back right now.\u005cn\u005cnI'm not speaking of this specific case here  - but there's a good reason that's standard advice.

As the second test rolled around, the students who\u005cn studied little had studied 'even less' and the ones who studied hard \u005cndecided they wanted a free ride too so they studied 'little'.\u005cxa0\u005cnThe second test average was a 'D'.\u005cxa0\u005cxa0 No one was happy.\u005cxa0\u005cxa0 When the 3rd test rolled around, the average was an F.\u005cxa0As\u005cn the tests proceeded, the scores never increased as bickering, blame and\u005cn name-calling all resulted in hard feelings and no one would study for \u005cnthe benefit of anyone else.\u005cxa0\u005cnTo their great surprise, ALL FAILED and the professor told them that\u005cn "socialism" would also ultimately 'fail' because when the reward is \u005cngreat, the effort to succeed is great, but when government takes all the\u005cn reward away, no one will try or want to succeed.\u005cnCould not be any simpler than that.Remember, there IS a test coming up; elections sometime soon; your chance to have YOUR say.\u005cnThese are possibly the 5 best sentences you'll ever read and all applicable to this experiment:1. You cannot legislate the poor into prosperity by legislating the wealthy out of prosperity.\u005cn2. What one person receives without working for, another person must work for without receiving.3. The government cannot give to anybody anything that the government does not first take from somebody else.\u005cn4. You cannot multiply wealth by dividing it!5. When half of\u005cn the people get the idea that they do not have to work because the other\u005cn half is going to take care of them, and when the other half gets the \u005cnidea that it does no good to work because somebody else is going to get \u005cnwhat they work for, that is the beginning of the end of any nation.

Remember that white bitch, that lived with gorillas for 18 years? HUH? Her name was Dian Fossey, a zoologist/zoophilia. What about the white bitch, who was sexing her monkey, that ended up tearing her face apart? REMEMBER THAT?CUT THE HAIR OFF A MONKEY; YOU WILL GET A HONKEY, i.e., thin lips, flat red ass, slumped over, big ears, funky stinch odor, and are easily trained!Now, go back to the jungle with your monkey/ape family! lolJUNGLE LOVE...you got that right! Y\u005c\u005c'all caucasoid monkeys LOVE apes and gorillas!!!beastiality = 1. Sexual relations between a person and an animal, including intercourse, masturbation, cunnilingus, frottage (rubbing), anal penetration, or having ones genitals licked by an animal. 2. A synonym for zoophilia, but a distinction is sometimes made between bestiality, a sexual act with animals, and zoophilia, sexual arousal from contacts with animals.

It is a perk they negotiated, but it is not a particularly good argument for why teachers are underpaid.\u005cn\u005cnDon't spout critical thinking now. This "teach to the test" stuff is relatively recent. The miserable state of Chicago public schools is not. It may not be a matter of getting rid of all the overpaid teachers, but getting rid of the bad one is a good start. How do we judge the bad ones? Well, that seems like a point of negotiation to me, but the current program doesn't seem to work.

aVAs if you needed a government agency to clean up litter. That's one of things I've noticed about people who live in big government, socialist societies: They seem to have lost their basic human self-initiative. Something which is very glaring to an American. Over here, if there's litter, we don't jump immediately to blaming the government. We blame ourselves for being slobs and then somebody, somehwere will create and organize a volunteer effort to clean it up. I saw uplifting glimpses of that spirit from the volunteers who cleaned up the streets of London after the recent riots. Gave me hope that one day Britain will go back to a small government, self-reliant society. Even decades of living under a socialist nany state can't totally kill your spirit.

aVSo I'm first going to comment on the school lunch issue, because I've had a similar experience. It was brought to my attention that my kids were buying lunch, but not eating it. I decided to pack their lunch. My kids will not eat a sandwich so I decided I was not going to waste food or money packing a sandwich and instead substituted cheese and crackers or peanut butter crackers, which is an appropriate substitute for grain/meat. I then packed carrots, a fruit (generally an orange or apple) or a fruit cup, and a granola bar (also a grain alternative. I was sent a note home that it was unacceptable to not have a sandwich included in their lunch. I worked at the time in the lunch room of a day care and knew what was acceptable and unacceptable according to the USDA, but in my opinion what the USDA requires of a public facility offering lunch and what I offer should be totally seperate. The eating habits of my children is my business, their health is in my hands. I feel sorry for children whose parents choose to set bad examples, and for parents that don't care enough and let their children live off of take out and junk but that is their choice. \u005c\u005cnI will now address the abortion issue that was thrown in just because I find it A) outrageous to even mention it, and B) because people are uneducated and base take things out of context or base it off of hearsay and uneducated opinions. I personally don't believe it's right in all circumstances. I believe there are other options, I believe that their are also situations where it may be necessary, medically, or mentally; as in a rape case. BUT I also believe that it is our bodies, we do in fact own them, the fetus is a person but it is not seperated from you until birth, which makes it yours until then. State has enough power already, controlling what I do with my body is my business. I don't believe they should be allowed to tell me I can or can't have one. I also don't think all insurance companies should have to pay for it, unless of course it's a medically neccessary procedure due to health risks of the mother, the fetus or in the case of rape/incest. I don't think insurance companies should be allowed to tell you that you can't buy birth control, that is taking it to far. I realize certain religions don't believe in birth control, they believe that if God wants you to have a baby he'll give you one but he didn't put these people on Earth that invented these things for nothing. If there was a flood and a boat came by I would get in, I wouldn't wait for God, God sent the boat. I wish people would realize that this country is religiously diverse, it was founded on religious diversity, state and religion should be seperate and publicly owened companies (company's with stock on NASDAQ etc.) and religion should be seperate. No religion has the right to enforce their beliefs on others. It's sad to say that as Christian, especially of the Baptist denomination that is more frequent than in any other religion. The religion that worships Alla (sp) doesn't ask that everyone bow down for 10 minutes at high noon for prayer, Catholics don't require or ask other religions to go to confession, Jews don't ask that more Jewish holidays be made official government holidays. The Baptist scream for Christmas, and Easter and anti abortion (as do the Catholic on that one (they are a denomination of Christians). I just think people need less power and more tolerance of others. Jesus/God was not a judgemental person, in fact he was the opposite of that, he taught acceptance and love of all, even those that turned away from him. We could all learn from that, quit thumping your Bible and actually read it.

Mr. SEC says, "Like it or not, Kansas City is still Big 12 territory." That is 100% true. Kansas City is major Big 12 territory. That being said, things are about to change. For all we know, the Big 12 might not even exist in 2017 and the contract with the Big 12 college basketball tournament expires in 2014. Big 12 Commissioner Chuck Neinas came on Kansas City radio yesterday, saying that the Big 12 wants Kansas City as their host city for the long-term and are hopeful that the SEC will not continue to pursue a tournament here.

And time we had just decreased tremendously . \u005cr\u005cn  Now, her little brother, JAVIER, 5 years old is the worst kid ever in the history of worst kid.

Either way, Komen has seen the last of a lot of donors over this - hope they're prepared for the fallout.

No religion is better or truer than another.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0Many people see a close connection between religion and ethics for good reason: ethical principles like love, compassion, mercy, charity, and justice are common foundations to all major religions. Its when the fundamentalists of every religion that is the problem.\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0The fact that we are not trying to analyze how a god came into existence shows that the likelihood of a god is minimal. Suggesting that a God did something and created everything is just an easy answer for simple people over many years. Now we are far more educated and have questioned these beliefs that have been sheepishly followed since humans were able to reason. As always the first question that must occur if you say yes is \u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9cbut who made god then\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx9d it cannot all just be faith that creates an entity that has the ability to press a button.

It's just that we've had it for over 10 years, so telling a crowd of people here that you are blown away by touch screen won't help you relate to them.\u005cn\u005cnIt's kind of like telling the story where you fixed the dog shit on the roof problem by hosing your dog off and letting him freeze on the roof.

aVI wouldn't count on Davis for bringing a team past 25 wins in his first season.  Bigs take at least 3 years to get used to the speed of the game and I'm not sure if we've seen enough to know if he can be truly dominant (he needs to put A LOT of work in).  Hopefully he won't have the injuries some of the other recent big men have had.

It was no accident that we "gave" them that land after the war.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSo if you ever try to discuss this topic with someone and all facts and reason seem to be going nowhere, understand you are likely talking to a person that holds their faith above logic and reasoning or they have been spoon fed misinformation by those that do.

aVFunny how the left and gay activists applaud the decision by vote of a legislative body (in New Jersey), but vehemently reject and attack the decision by vote of the people (of California) whom a legislative body represents. This is not about rights, but about the agenda of one particular group who will stop at nothing to get what they want. This proves they value government over the people, which is exactly why our founding fathers incited a revolution.

aV14 REASONS 2 IGNORE THE SMEAR CAMPAIGN AGAINST RON PAUL  1. He didn't even write those newsletters. Do you think Oprah writes everything that is in O Magazine?  2. Look what all the other guys are doing. Santorum is so homophobic look his name up on Google. Obama is killing brown skinned people every day in Afghanistan and Pakistan. Gingrich and Romney are crazy.   3. Ron Paul already apologized for letting others use his name like that in those newsletters.  4. Ron Paul didn't even know what was in those newsletters. He made a mistake by trusting the editors, but that doesn't make him racist.  5. People act like 'sheeple' and just want to maintain the status quo.  6. Most who are attacking Ron Paul are bigger racists than he is.  7. Ron Paul wants to end the war.  8. Ron Paul has delivered black babies for free, a racist wouldn't do that.  9. Libertarians see people as people, not collectives.  10. Ron Paul would legalize marijuana and end the war on drugs.  11. Ron Paul didn\u005c\u005cxe2\u005c\u005cx80\u005c\u005cx99t write the ads for the newsletter.  12. There are more important things to talk about than some statements from 20 years ago that are being taken out of context.  13. This is just a coordinated smear campaign anyway.  14. There are no better candidates than Ron Paul.

aVI know many songwriters (myself included) that feel - for lyric writing especially - that the morning (after you first roll out of bed) is a very free association and productive period. I have a good friend who wrote many hit songs who made himself take one or two naps during the day so that he can have a few of these precious, inspired periods per day. Some songs can happen instantly - but some songwriters might spend the same amount of time on a great song as someone might spend writing a whole book. That all being said - for creative artist type writing - when you have to write something for a film or TV show ASAP, or have a deadline to get a song to an artist - you just have to do it and not make such a big deal out of it all. After you do it a number of times you gain confidence and no longer doubt the inevitable favorable outcome of your efforts - in fact you totally enjoy the intense focus and process. If you are getting freaky, overwhelmed, stressed or grumpy about any aspect - that is writer's stage fright - eventually you will find that to be unnecessary & counter productive. (...and it will make your friends & family wish you find a new profession!!)

aVObama made a big mistake at the start of his presidency-he placed the cart before the horse when he spent his capital on Obamacare when he should have been focussed on the economy-without economist Paul Krugman's advise (Krugman is an idiot). Once the economy was on track he would have been relected and could have passed his Obamacare-but he did not do that-he had to appease his socialist base (the Nancy Pelosis and her ilk) and reinforce his ideology. I think the old Democratic Party hacks will force him out and allow Romney in for the next 4 years as a stepping stone to Hillary Clinton in 2016. If Obama wins people will not relect a Democrat for the next two terms and that would do Hillary in.  Clinton is paving the way for his wfie-believe me Obamalama, you're out partner-go back to what you do best-be a member of the UN and foster a peace plan with Assa in Syria and better yet, go back tyo Chicago and straighten that murder capital out, won't you??.

aVRandal, I don't want to beat up on you here since I'm very grateful you invited me to co-write God or Godless. I agree skeptics are learning something from you. So let me revise my speculation to be more precise. Most non-believers, especially former Christians, have CONSIDERED YOUR CONCLUSIONS BEFORE, but most Christians have not considered \u005cnthe things I say. You are interesting. I'll grant you that. Perhaps what interests them is something Dr. Valerie Tarico said of my magnum opus:<blockquote>What is unusual about Loftus is his breadth and depth of research in \u005cndefense of the Christian faith before finally rejecting his faith. \u005cnLoftus applies himself in this book with the same intellectual rigor he \u005cnhad applied to defending the faith, and effectively dissects those very \u005cnsame arguments. I found myself marveling at the impressively contorted \u005cnreasoning used by apologists through the ages in defense of their \u005cnreceived traditions. They are worth reading from the standpoint of \u005cncognitive psychology alone.</blockquote>You illustrate this better than most every other Christian apologist out there.

He's a sad man to believe that he's so superior and above above all the other Presidents. He always have to be bouncing up and down the stairs like a spring chicken and always have to try and be hip with the greeting hugs and the flapping of chest to chest with the hand shake to top it off. Many times he speaks in a preaching tone of voice and wants to sound like the late Dr King, the truth is all he needs is some one on podium with him to play the organ. The man is an actor and really belong in Hollywood  no wonder he always hangs with the Hollywood crowds and he pretends to be a rock star. Like he stated 'my White House, I wonder what will comes out his mouth next. Oh he also stated that the private sector is doing fine. It's sad that many in theses United States are having a hard time and suffering and he has no clue nor really could care less as long as he has a place to stay and 3 square meals every day and in his White House as he stated.. Oh by the way have you all notice that everything that is going on is not his fault but it's the fault of everyone else but him, according to him he's doing a great job and everyone else is doing a lousy job, in other words he's 100% perfect without any flaws more that the master that created these heaven and earth and created every thing within it's borders, the I say he must be powerful so much more that God.

aV\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0But in the real world, not yours filled with bigotry, gay marriage cannot be illegal under religious means because you are forcing someone, by law, to practice your beliefs and the government is restricted by the first amendment to support religious laws.

It's a serial interface.\u005cn\u005cnNonetheless, this design here is fake - it has contacts for a touch-sensitive, non-mechanical button left from the home-button, which is a hint at a Android-Chinese-Fakephone.\u005cnAnd the headset is on the bottom - not Apple-like at all.

aVYou are wrong about brown people having to prove they're citizens - that idiotic law is on ice. Cops don't like it. They know there will be a shit storm of law suits and civil disobedience if it is upheld. And for the umpteenth time, that was MY congressman who was shot by a disturbed person had a long history of bizarre behavior. Any mass shootings in Michigan, or wherever you are from? Brewer was only a pissant secretary of state and became gov. because Janet Napolitano resigned, \u005cxa0putting her ambition before the state. Fuck her. \u005cxa0Perhaps we should go down the list of crazy tea baggers in every state of the union, every mass shooting, every crazy law that has been passed by tea baggers - who got their way because the left and center were too lazy, complacent and disorganized to compete with them.\u005cnThe stereotyping that has gone on here on this forum would make nativists and team baggers very happy indeed. They can say \u005cxa0"see - they're just like us"\u005cn\u005cnDo you all talk shit about Alabama, which has a stronger immigration law than the one in AZ which ISN'T being enforced? If you do, you are wrong to do that - Morris Dees and the SPLC are from Alabama, as are a lot of other decent human beings who resist the craziness that tea baggers are doing their damndest to spread around. The cowards who won't say where they are from on this forum love to talk shit - but lack the tanates to take it.

aVThis effort on mankind to legalize "gay marriage" is foolishness. God and the Bible never has recognized such. In fact, the only marriage He authorized is between one man and one woman. No matter what laws are passed an enforced to protect "gay marriage," we, Christias, will never accept it as marriage, nor will we stop preaching sermons, etc. teaching from the Bible that such practices are sinful and against God. In addition, we cannot, in accordance with the Bible, say yes to performing "gay weddings." Gay marriage is not what God created "in the beginning."

aVIDS is one of a dying breed. Politicians who really try to do what is right and fair. I\u005c\u005c'm sick to death of the lefties harping on about \u005c\u005c'the most vulnerable in society\u005c\u005c', when the people they refer to are really "the scoungers" in our society. The government are not trying to put genuine needy people into unfair situations. They are trying to be fair, by not making those in work pay unreasonable amounts to fund those not working. The left know this, but won\u005c\u005c't admit it because it doesn\u005c\u005c't suit their agenda. Those who\u005c\u005c're working deserve a fair deal too.

aVI have owned guns all my life,I'm going to buy more guns.I would encourage all white Americans to buy all the guns and ammo you can afford.Learn how to use your guns,buy night vision,laser sights,practice often, anything that will make your shooting more accurate,buy guns and ammo and bury them in different places,teach your kids how to use them and teach them there is nothing wrong with defending yourself.Encourage your friends to do the same,let them know how liberals and minorities really think.Remember,it is your constitutional right to keep and bear arms for the right of self defense.Support the NRA.,and never forget that the liberal democrats want to take your guns and your gun rights.These rights are GOD given and backed up by the constitution,all the signers of the constitution were white men,most of the people that want to take your guns are not.

aVI don't buy Gordon Brown was as hated as all that. By the time of the election public opinion had begun to swing towards him, because it was clear he WAS being subjected to a particularly virulent character assassination.\u005cxa0\u005cxa0 How else can you explain him being villified for writing in large letters and mis-spelling a name when he's damn near blind? I thought writing a hand-written letter to a dead soldiers mother showed some heart and decency, whatever I thought of his politics.\u005cnStill, considering Osbourne supported all of Gordon's policies when they seemed to work, attacking him for legit reasons would have been rather difficult..

Many gay men look after themselves to a far greater extent than their heterosexual counterparts...

Microsoft and Sony....using the same graphics card? \u005cxa0There would be no point because both the games on the consoles, even with console exclusives would look the same and I'm pretty sure Microsoft and Sonys main goal is to have better looking games then the other....not games that look the same but are on different systems.

(And it isn't this.)\u005cn\u005cnBut that's really beside the point, because anyone with a brain knows that Rove's opinion can't even qualify as a lie. I really can't believe you are this dumb.

aVGosh, Peggy Hill ... Don't make me laugh. In addition to money, Romney won because Newt is bombastic and is likely a serious liability in the general ... all the polls show it and intelligent conservatives feel it ... this is about style not substance. Both will do the basically the same things in office just with entirely different styles. Newt ruffles feathers all day long with his growing obsession to draw stark contrasts all of the time ... especially when if and when it entails lying or exagerrating ... like calling Mitt anti-immigrant on national TV, unbelievable. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnAnd since Peggy Hill knows less about national politics than I do since I have studied it to some degree for 25 odd years, I'm not inclined to be persuaded by her often amateurish, yet heartfelt, patriotic opinions. She describes the political scene the way I used to 15 years ago ... lots of generalities with little to no expertise, so I don't pay her a lot of attention when we disagree. In fairness, her scope of knowledge, when it comes to national politics, is growing by the day. I feel she would be competent to run for VP in 2016 but I would much rather see her in a Dept of Energy position since she gets on my nerves from time to time (though not badly) and I don't trust her instincts as much these days since she wants Mitt out of the race ... the one guy who is sure to beat Owebamao! Of course she hasn't said she wants Mitt out but we all know she does because she is behind Newt, 100%.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSarah Palin is a Great American and I love her and Newt dearly but this is not the time to vote with my heart ... way too much at stake! Newt is the world's best field general but his temper and tone are starting to wear on me and I'm conservative, for Pete's sake ... I can only imagine how offended some Independents are beginning to feel. \u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnSure it helped that Mitt raised more money ... and that is essential in beating Dingle Barry, as well. Sarah kinda sounds like an OWS'er ranting that Mitt had too much money as if Newt wouldn't have wanted to have that much money, too. And thank God Mitt raised all that cash ... after all ... that's what it's all about! So you Newt zombies really ought to do the Hokey Pokey and turn yourselves around, lol.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnIf Newt will fold under lies and carpet bombing ... as he said he would ... then he's got zero chance of beating Owebamao ... think about it ... that's all Barry does.

I know he will beat Owebamao (all that matters) and I know he will attract Independents and Latinos in 2014... particularly with a Romney/Rubio ticket. My first choice for POTUS is a Christy/Rubio ticket ... neither are running but both back Romney.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBy the time Super Tuesday rolls around, Mitt will prolly already be the clear front runner but I never count Newt out.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBut for Peggy Hill to be upset Mitt raised and outspent Newt is laughable .... that's what you're supposed to do!\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBTW Folks - Remember the Sirens???\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cnBeautiful half-woman, half-bird, Newt-like creatures who sang such sweet songs that listeners forgot about everything including their own safety. The Sirens were Newtish sisters who lured sailors to their untimely deaths. The songs of the Sirens were irresistible but they resided beyond unsurpassable reefs which destroyed the sailors' boat (think Costa Concordia) when they tried to reach the Sirens. Among those tempted were Jason on the Argo and Odysseus. Odysseus escaped from them by filling his crew's ears with wax while he tied himself to the ship's mast, thus finally allowing the GOP to win their prize ........ just sayin'.

aV@Don S I\u005c\u005c'm pretty sure the idea of runaway positive feedback in the "global warming" context goes back to Hansen in the 80s and the beginning of the whole movement (after the previous new ice age movement, of course). His specialty was Venus and its unique atmospheric dynamics. Somehow he became convinced that the same would happen to Earth, even though the necessary vulcanism, proximity to the sun, lack of a biosphere and water cycle and atmospheric composition are all totally non-Earth like. But he is convinced we\u005c\u005c'll turn Earth into a new Venus, even though we can\u005c\u005c't, and the fact that his projections are failing badly means that his acolytes and people not even aware of where this crap came from are now inventing non-physical tipping points at unknown times in the near future to justify continuing panic. The fact that Hansen engineered a hot un-airconditioned room back in his original testimony to your politicians is a testament to the fact he is not really much of a scientist.\u005c\u005cn\u005c\u005cn(Of course in engineering and real systems, positive feedback is ultimately limited by saturation somewhere in the system... but they don\u005c\u005c't seem to identify what will saturate first in the climate system.)

aVThat's a hitachi vibrator! Good call. I read in this truly great punk zine years ago that if you were going to get a vibrator, that was THE one. The writer even drew a little comic of herself going home from a show alone (because she was trying not to fuck strangers while drunk, etc.) with X's for eyes because she just laid there for hours getting off. For her it was a good thing because it kept her from acting out situations that were unhealthy for her. Isn't that all that matters? Maybe I've just internalized feminism too much (and don't understand the nuances of sex addiction) but it seems wrong for another person to police your fantasies. Who masturbates thinking of rose petals and commitment ceremonies? Ew. You have control over what you actually do but you should be able to fantasy about dirty sex with strangers all you want, in my humble opinion.

aVI don't know what to think about LW1 - it's possible that she's just not a facebook type person.  Maybe she should change her settings so she doesn't get the updates and photos.  That way she can look at their page if she feels like it but she won't be seeing more than she really wants to know. \u005cn\u005cnI have to agree though that writing about awesome presents you received or how much you really love, love, love your awesome BF, or telling everyone about your Valentines plans - seems a little like what CH called over sharing.  I guess because it's not the kind of the info that I would think about announcing.  For example, if my husband gives me an awesome gift - I don't rush to the phone to call everyone I know and tell them or even do a mass email to let everyone know.  Same with plans for special occasions.  \u005cn\u005cnIf someone asks me - then of course I'll tell them.  But the announcing to the world thing does seem a little over the top when it comes to things like that.  But then, that's the kind of world we live in - people twittering their every move.  Someone must be interested.  And I think that it can become a sort of habit to post everything on facebook, to the point where I doubt that they're really thinking that much about it.  \u005cn\u005cnI think the LW should just ignore it - she doesn't have to 'do' facebook the way everyone else does.  If she thinks it's weird to go on and on about the BF - then she doesn't have to.

aVCardinals are quite good outside of QB.  They finished the year 7-1 I think.  They are hilariously bad at QB though.  Depends on whether you go there, or if you're hosting.  The Rams should improve, but to what degree is hard to know (and they were terrible last year).  Seattle had the #9 D in the league last year despite a terrible offense.  They improved on paper.  If we get mediocre QB play this year you will have a tough game at Seattle.

p4741
aV@truth34 *clap, clap* - Bravo. You comment certainly is the most brillant and intellectually challenging piece I had the pleasure to read in ages. You are really doing well defending your standpoint in such an outstanding way. And I will critize as long as I want to, I don't care if I come from Germany, France or Timbuktu.
p4742

aVThis is why the rest of the world hates America. We invade your country (too many times to count), rape your children (I\u005c\u005c'm thinking particularly of the gang rape of a\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0fourteen-year-old Afghan girl, the murder of her and her family, the burning of their house, and the cover-up within the military of those who had done it - but that\u005c\u005c's just the instance most fresh in my mind), murder your civilians (again, too many times to count), and the men and women who do it get a slap on the wrist if they are even\u005c\u005cxc2\u005c\u005cxa0punished at all. Do you warmongers now understand why no one thinks we deserve to tell other nations how to live "morally?" We\u005c\u005c've got a pretty freaking long way to go on that front ourselves, particularly among the military that we send over to get the job done.
p4751
aVThis is a scam. And the loser that made the video was caught masturbating in public. You are all so stupid.
p4752
aVAnother dumb comment. Put America first before your idiotic views
p4753
aVGo use google simpleton, that's how the word is spelled.\u005cxa0 You dense democrat!
p4754
aVRB ypc is based off the avg....and that avg contains big plays.\u005cn\u005cnTake away Fortes big play from each game and his avg would be much worse as well.
p4755

p4756
aVThe dead guy was raping his daughter for chrissakes!! Any 'bad blood' goes out the window at that point. I hope for your and their sake that you don't have kids.
p4757
aVThe fatman should give them a shot at the WC
p4758
aV@reddyman You mean get my owner to walk me, i am a poodle you mug.

aVMelissa, I've loved you from the first day I saw you on the show!  You have a beautiful family and your music talent is undeniable.  You and Theresa do have one thing in common - you are both strong ladies - that's a good thing.  Theresa is used to getting her way, she is a bully, and I'm glad to see you stand up for yourself and your family.  I see all these comments on the website that Theresa should get her own show.  NOPE - you should have your own show!  Let me know who I need to talk to!  :)
p4760
aVwhat in the fuckkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkkk
p4761
aVObviously the comic books you read have done you no good. I bet if your keyboard looked like crayons you'd almost sound intaligent.
p4762
aVsince when does age have anything to do with being an artist? \u005cni'm pretty sure some of the world's best artists are very old now.\u005cnand i'm also pretty sure there are a bunch of young kids with amazing talent that we haven't even heard from yet.
p4763
aVnobody has arrested george w bush or dick cheney for the murders of over 3000 people on 9 / 11 ... why should we expect a quicker result with assad ... ?
p4764
aVGive up jamal jrk off, I would never possibly waste time trying to communicate with an extraordinarily juvenile 49 year old, lightly educated\u005cxa0 racist. You are probably some angry house bound loser sitting there with your stupid, bigoted comments, lashing out at the Black people whom you know to be your superiors. You really couldn't be more pathetic.
p4765
aVSoon we will all be pledging allegiance to the United States of Obama!
p4766
aVNever really gave it much thought. I just figured through the back door!
p4767
aVNadie se salva de la regla 34 xd
p4768
aVQuestion: Are you a boy or a girl?
p4769
aVLeave your email or phone number and maybe you 2 twits can meet up and beat each other up.\u005cxa0 tough guy talk online is cheap. go ahead and man up midnight train and do the real thing. dont be an internet pussy! fight him in a ring. dont talk shit DO IT!
p4770
aVFrom the scenarios you present, I see you believe all people ARE robots. Abraham, no matter his environment or upbringing chose to aim his gun at the poor guy he killed, and he chose to pull the trigger. He has a bad childhood, so let's understand why he would kill someone?\u005cnWhen he's older, he doesn't have the sense to realize that going before the judge, you might want to appear humble and show some respect. Two things by the way that wasn't taught to him as a child and appears as a man is not important to him. Again, his choice. \u005cnHe knows selling drugs is wrong and could land him back in jail. Again, a stupid, premeditated decision on his part. And he will be in jail shortly after he gets out because that's what a stupid unteachable, hardened piece of clay does. Turn down the same road.\u005cn\u005cnAnd you're right. I am saying all this from MY perspective. Like I said in my other comment, most people could be put in Abraham's exact shoes and they won't raise a gun and shoot that poor man dead.\u005cnHumans...............not robots.
